\chapter{Acknowledgements}

There is no \textit{I} in science (from a conceptual, not orthographical point of view),
therefore I must extend my thanks to all the collaborators who have joined me 
in this three year journey. First, dear defects, I was happy to be part
of our little adventures throughout the world. 
Carlos, Collin and, in particular, Joao,
thank you for going out of your way to receive me in your midst in Leuven
(and teaching me to enjoy belgian beer).
Chiara, Roberto, Anna, Ganna, Pengu, Mujahid, Miguel, Hilmar, Stefano, Emily, Rifan.

Fruitful collaborations are often found outside initial domains. To this end, many
thanks to Simon and Jack and the rest of the Dresden group for providing an 
avenue for interesting fundamental research.
I am waiting to hear your names in a Nobel prize some time in the future. No pressure.
Other collaborations may be destined to bear fruit through friendship instead,
so I hope we will meet yet again Eder, preferably with some \textit{jamón}.

Life-work balance might be slightly skewed when in a PhD, but my co-workers made 
one feel like the other. Merci Emily et Sandrine pour votre aide et patience
(je jure que ce n'est pas moi qui brise tout et j'espère que vous allez
trouver vos échantillons \cancel{cachées} rangées dans les boites et les armoires).


Si, la final, trebuie sa multumesc familiei mele, care a crezut in mine si mi-a fost
alaturi prin infinitele capricii ale unui doctorat.
