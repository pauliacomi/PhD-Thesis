\section{UiO-66(Zr) for defect study}%
\label{appx:synthesis:takeda}

The Takeda 5A carbon was purchased directly from the Takeda corporation.
The sample was activated at \SI{250}{\celsius} under vacuum (\SI{5}{\milli\bar})
before any measurements.

\section{UiO-66(Zr) for defect study}%
\label{appx:synthesis:uio66def}

The UiO-66(Zr) sample preparation was adapted from Shearer et al. 
\cite{shearerTunedToPerfection2014} as follows:
\ce{ZrCl4} (\SI{1.55}{\gram}, \SI{6.65}{\milli\mol}), an excess of 
terephthalic acid (BDC)
(\SI{1.68}{\gram}, \SI{10.11}{\milli\mol}), \ce{HCl} 37 \% solution 
(\SI{0.2}{\milli\litre}, \SI{3.25}{\milli\mol}) and N,Nâ€™-dimethylformamide (DMF) 
(\SI{200}{\milli\litre}, \SI{2.58}{\mol}) were added to a \SI{250}{\milli\litre}
pressure resistant Schott bottle. The mixture was stirred for 10 min, followed by incubation in 
convection oven at \SI{130}{\celsius} for \SI{24}{\hour}. The resulting white precipitate was 
washed with fresh DMF (\(3 \times \) \SI{50}{\milli\litre}) 
followed by ethanol (\(3 \times \) \SI{50}{\milli\litre})
over the course of 48 h and dried at \SI{60}{\celsius}. After drying, 
the sample was activated 
on a vacuum oven by heating at \SI{200}{\celsius} under vacuum for 12 h. 
The yield was 78 \% white microcrystalline powder. Before the experiment, 
the sample was calcined
at \SI{250}{\celsius} under vacuum (\SI{5}{\milli\bar}) to remove any residual solvents
from the framework.

\section{MIL-127(Fe) for shaping study}%
\label{appx:synthesis:mil127shaping}

MIL-127(Fe) was synthesized by reaction of
\ce{Fe(ClO4)3*6H2O} (\SI{3.27}{\gram}, \SI{9.2}{\milli\mol}) and 
\ce{C16N2O8H6} (\SI{3.3}{\gram}) in DMF
(\SI{415}{\milli\litre}) and hydrofluoric acid (5 M, \SI{2.7}{\milli\litre}) at 
\SI{423}{\kelvin} in a Teflon
flask. The obtained orange crystals were placed in DMF (\SI{100}{\milli\litre})
and stirred at ambient temperature for \SI{5}{\hour}. The final product was
kept at \SI{375}{\kelvin} overnight.MIL-127(Fe) was synthesized by reaction of
