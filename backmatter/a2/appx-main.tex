\section{MIL-127(Fe)  for shaping study}

MIL-127(Fe) was synthesized by reaction of
\ce{Fe(ClO4)3*6H2O} (\SI{3.27}{\gram}, \SI{9.2}{\milli\mol}) and 
\ce{C16N2O8H6} (\SI{3.3}{\gram}) in DMF
(\SI{415}{\milli\litre}) and hydrofluoric acid (5 M, \SI{2.7}{\milli\litre}) at 
\SI{423}{\kelvin} in a Teflon
flask. The obtained orange crystals were placed in DMF (\SI{100}{\milli\litre})
and stirred at ambient temperature for \SI{5}{\hour}. The final product was
kept at \SI{375}{\kelvin} overnight.MIL-127(Fe) was synthesized by reaction of
