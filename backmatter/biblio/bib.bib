  abstract = {The nanoporous and tunable nature of metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) has made them promising adsorbents for water adsorption applications such as water harvesting and adsorptive heat pumps. In these applications, water adsorption properties in MOFs play a crucial role. However, understanding their structural defects and how defects influence adsorption thermodynamics remains limited to date. In this work, by employing Monte Carlo techniques and first-principle density functional theory calculations, we investigate the effect of defects on the water adsorption properties in MOF-801 structures at an atomic level. Our calculations show that the adsorption isotherm in perfect MOF-801 (without defects) greatly deviates from that measured experimentally. With the introduction of defects with a high density, a reasonably good agreement can be achieved, suggesting that a high defect density in MOF-801 may be responsible for its hydrophilic adsorptive behaviors. Further, water adsorption properties in MOF-801 structures are found to depend on the spatial configuration of defects, and water condensation in nanoporous MOF-801 is identified to occur preferentially along the \langle{}110\rangle{} direction. Detailed structural characteristics (accessible volume, etc.) of MOF-801 structures and the adsorption energetics of water in the frameworks are also studied and correlated with the computed adsorption isotherms. Our findings reveal important insights into the role of defects, offering a microscopic picture to help facilitate the rational design of better MOFs for water adsorption applications.},

  abstract = {We present the synthesis and characterization of a novel Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF) which contains fumarate (fum) dianions as linkers: -OOC-CHCH-COO -. The synthesis of this MOF is possible only via modulation, i.e. by the addition of a monocarboxylic acid to the synthesis mixture. We have used formic acid as a modulator and have investigated its influence on the synthesis of the Zr-fumarate MOF in detail. The modulator improves the crystallinity of the material; varying its amounts, the crystal size and the degree of aggregation can be influenced. The novel MOF probably has a topology which is similar to that of UiO-66, but has a primitive cubic lattice instead of a face-centered one. A structural model in line with the experimental data is proposed. The Zr-fum MOF is further characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Ar sorption, showing that it can be activated and exhibits microporosity. The linker fumarate as well as the modulator formic acid used in the synthesis of Zr-fum MOF are both naturally occurring molecules; possible applications of the MOF may thus lie in the field of biomaterials. Therefore, the stability of Zr-fum MOF was tested in water-based salt solutions commonly used in biomedical research. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Scientific progress is severely impeded if experimental measurements are not reproducible. Materials chemistry and related fields commonly report new materials with limited attention paid to reproducibility. Here, we describe methods that are well suited to assessing reproducibility in these fields via retrospective analysis of reported data. This concept is illustrated by an exhaustive analysis of a topic that has been the focus of thousands of published studies, gas adsorption in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. We show that for the well-studied case of CO2 adsorption there are only 15 of the thousands of known MOFs for which enough experiments have been reported to allow strong conclusions to be drawn about the reproducibility of these measurements. Our results have immediate implications for the characterization of gas adsorption in porous materials but, more importantly, demonstrate an approach to assessing reproducibility that will be widely applicable in materials chemistry.},

  abstract = {ZIF-8 is a zeolitic imidazole-based metal\`Aorganic framework with large cavities interconnected by narrow windows. Because the small size of the windows, it allows in principle for molecular sieving of gases such as H2 and CH4. However, the unexpected adsorption of large molecules on ZIF-8 suggests the existence of structural flexibility. ZIF-8 flexibility is explored in this work combining different experimental techniques with molecular simulation. We show that the ZIF-8 structure is modified by gas adsorption uptake in the same way as it is at a very high pressure (i.e., 14 700 bar) due to a swing effect in the imidazolate linkers, giving access to the porosity. Tuning the flexibility, and so the opening of the small windows, has a further impact on the design of advanced molecular sieving membrane materials for gas separation, adjusting the access of fluids to the porous network.},
