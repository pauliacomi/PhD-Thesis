  abstract = {Negative gas adsorption by a porous crystalline solid, DUT-49, observed by spontaneous desorption of gas during a pressure increase raises fundamental questions on the physical origin of this puzzling behavior. Importantly, a framework that can transform a large amount of strain into pressure has many possible technological applications. To address this question, we studied the mechanics and thermodynamics of DUT-49 at both the molecular unit and framework scales by applying quantum density functional theory and extensive classical molecular-dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that negative gas adsorption originates from molecular buckling of the organic structural unit and thus allows a colossal framework transformation. Methane adsorption is subsequently shown to activate this transition, in full agreement with experimental observations. The molecular insight presented here unveils the mechanics and thermodynamics responsible for negative gas adsorption and provides unparalleled understanding to aid the discovery of new examples of similarly responsive porous metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks are a novel family of chemically diverse materials, which are of interest across engineering, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine-based disciplines. Since the development of the field in its current form more than two decades ago, priority has been placed on the synthesis of new structures. However, more recently, a clear trend has emerged in shifting the emphasis from material design to exploring the chemical and physical properties of structures already known. In particular, although such nanoporous materials were traditionally seen as rigid crystalline structures, there is growing evidence that large-scale flexibility, the presence of defects and long-range disorder are not the exception in metal-organic frameworks, but the rule. Here we offer some perspective into how these concepts are perhaps inescapably intertwined, highlight recent advances in our understanding and discuss how a consideration of the interfaces between them may lead to enhancements of the materials' functionalities.},

Traditionally interpenetration has been considered as a threat to permanent porosity and several strategies have been adopted to control the framework interpenetration. Recent literature reports have unveiled that interpenetration has paramount importance in several material properties particularly in storage and separation of small gas molecules. Such frameworks also show interesting structural flexibility based on shearing or movement of the nets and also reveals guest induced dynamic structural transformation for modulated specific functions. In this review, we will emphasize several interpenetration phenomena observed in coordination polymers, their intriguing structural aspects and fascinating material properties.},

Furthermore, 1 has been successfully miniaturized to nanoscale (MOF1N) of spherical morphology to study size dependent adsorption properties through a coordination modulation method. The two different SBUs, dinuclear paddle-wheel \{Zn2(COO)4\} for 1 and trinuclear \{Zn3($\mu$2-OCO)2(COO)4 \}for 2, direct the different network topologies of the frameworks that render different adsorption characteristics into the systems. Both of the frameworks show guest induced structural transformations as supported by PXRD studies. Adsorption studies of 1 and 2 show CO2 selectivity over several other gases (such as N2, H2, O2, and Ar) under identical experimental conditions. Interestingly, MOF1N exhibits significantly higher CO2 storage capacity compared to bulk crystals of 1 and that can be attributed to the smaller diffusion barrier at the nanoscale that is supported by studies of adsorption kinetics in both states. Kinetic measurement based on water vapor adsorption clearly distinguishes between the rate of diffusion of bulk (1) and nanospheres (MOF1N). The respective kinetic rate constant (k, s(-1)) for MOF1N (k = 1.29 \texttimes{} 10(-2) s(-1)) is found to be considerably higher than 1 (k = 7.1 \texttimes{} 10(-3) s(-1)) as obtained from the linear driving force (LDF) model. This is the first account where a new interpenetrated MOF has been scaled down to nanoscale through a coordination modulation method, and their difference in gas uptake properties has been correlated through a higher rate of mass diffusion as obtained from kinetics of adsorption.},

  abstract = {Adsorptive separation is very important in industry. Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents. With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas separation, adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-containing nodes connected by organic bridges, are such a new type of porous materials. They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas separations due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability. This critical review starts with a brief introduction to gas separation and purification based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs. Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions observed in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed. As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable molecular sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated. In addition to the experimental aspect, theoretical investigations from adsorption equilibrium to diffusion dynamics via molecular simulations are also briefly reviewed. Furthermore, gas separations in MOFs, including the molecular sieving effect, kinetic separation, the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 separation, and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 references).},

  abstract = {Adsorption-based phenomena are important in gas separations1, 2, such as the treatment of greenhouse-gas3 and toxic-gas4 pollutants, and in water-adsorption-based heat pumps5 for solar cooling systems. The ability to tune the pore size, shape and functionality of crystalline porous coordination polymers\textemdash{}or metal\textendash{}organic frameworks (MOFs)\textemdash{}has made them attractive materials for such adsorption-based applications3, 6, 7, 8. The flexibility and guest-molecule-dependent response9, 10 of MOFs give rise to unexpected and often desirable adsorption phenomena11, 12, 13, 14. Common to all isothermal gas adsorption phenomena, however, is increased gas uptake with increased pressure. Here we report adsorption transitions in the isotherms of a MOF (DUT-49) that exhibits a negative gas adsorption; that is, spontaneous desorption of gas (methane and n-butane) occurs during pressure increase in a defined temperature and pressure range. A combination of in situ powder X-ray diffraction, gas adsorption experiments and simulations shows that this adsorption behaviour is controlled by a sudden hysteretic structural deformation and pore contraction of the MOF, which releases guest molecules. These findings may enable technologies using frameworks capable of negative gas adsorption for pressure amplification in micro- and macroscopic system engineering. Negative gas adsorption extends the series of counterintuitive phenomena such as negative thermal expansion15, 16 and negative refractive indices17 and may be interpreted as an adsorptive analogue of force-amplifying negative compressibility transitions proposed for metamaterials18},

Conventional thermal activation yields a mixture of crystalline phases and some amorphous content. Exchange with a volatile solvent prior to vacuum activation produces a pure breathing phase with high sorption capacity, selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4, and substantial hysteresis. Supercritical drying can be used to access a guest-free open phase. Pressure-resolved differential scanning calorimetry was used to confirm and investigate a systematic loss of sorption capacity by the breathing phase as a function of successive cycles of sorption and desorption. A corresponding loss of sample integrity was not detectable by powder X-ray diffraction analysis. This may be an important factor to consider in cases where flexible MOFs are earmarked for industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Two families of molecular frameworks which grow as homochiral single crystals are described. Both consist of multiple interpenetration of the three-connected chiral (10,3)-a (Y*) network and result from the tridentate coordination of the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (btc) ligand to octahedral metal centers which act as linear connectors. The nature of the interpenetration is controlled by the auxiliary ligands bound in the equatorial plane of the metal center. Ethylene glycol (eg) binds in a unidentate fashion to form phase A which has 28\% accessible solvent volume and contains four interpenetrating (10,3)-a networks. 1,2-Propanediol (1,2pd) coordinates as a bidentate ligand to yield a phase B with a greatly enhanced 51\% of solvent accessible volume, because only two (distorted) (10,3)-a${'}$ networks interpenetrate. Ligands in the void space and bound to the metal center can both be liberated thermally: the kinetics of this process allow isolation of microporous desolvated crystalline A and B. The porous phases lose crystallinity reversibly upon further loss of ligands bound to the equatorial metal: crystallinity is restored upon exposure to the vapors of simple alcohols, which can also effect conversion of B to A. Both phases present interpenetrating network topologies that are unique to chemistry and adopt space groups that are new for molecular solids: A crystallizes in P4232 and B adopts I4132. B can be grown homochirally from enantiomerically pure diol template. The stereochemistry of the alcohol bound to the metal controls the helicity of the chiral framework. The structure determination of the 1,2-propanediol phase represents the first demonstration that chiral molecules can specifically template helix handedness in a chiral porous framework solid.},

Because the small size of the windows, it allows in principle for molecular sieving of gases such as H2 and CH4. However, the unexpected adsorption of large molecules on ZIF-8 suggests the existence of structural flexibility. ZIF-8 flexibility is explored in this work combining different experimental techniques with molecular simulation. We show that the ZIF-8 structure is modified by gas adsorption uptake in the same way as it is at a very high pressure (i.e., 14 700 bar) due to a swing effect in the imidazolate linkers, giving access to the porosity. Tuning the flexibility, and so the opening of the small windows, has a further impact on the design of advanced molecular sieving membrane materials for gas separation, adjusting the access of fluids to the porous network.},

The adsorption of gas on this complex suddenly begins at a de\textregistered{}nite relative pressure (‘gate pressure') regardless of almost nil adsorption below the gate pressure. Such a unique adsorption phenomenon is attributed to the hydrogen bond-regulated microporous nature of this complex; hydrogen bonds in pores block adsorption below the gate pressure.

While carbon dioxide can diffuse through these gates, methane and other guests cannot, leading to strong potential for gas separation. This effect has been attributed in the literature to specific cation- guest interactions that would allow CO2 to pull open the trapdoor. We investigate here the gating phenomenon using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with free energy methods. Our findings invalidate this previously proposed mechanism, showing that the presence of CO2 does not significantly affect the motion of the gating cation. We put forward and demonstrate an alternative mechanism, showing that the amplitude of the thermal motion of the cations is large and that CO2 is able to squeeze while the gate is open, while nonpolar guests such as methane cannot. This leads to an image of the mechanism that is closer to swinging doors than trapdoors.},

  abstract = {The metal-organic framework, MIL-53, can have a structural transition from an open-pored to a closed-pored structure by adsorbing different guest molecules. The aid of guest molecules is believed to be necessary to initiate this ``breathing'' effect. Using both neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering techniques, we find that MIL-53 exhibits a reversible structural transition between an openpored and a closed-pored structure as a function of temperature without the presence of any guest molecules. Surprisingly, this structural transition shows a significant temperature hysteresis: the transition from the open-pored to closed-pored structure occurs at approximately 125 to 150 K, while the transition from the closed-pored to open-pored structure occurs around 325 to 375 K. To our knowledge, this is first observation of such a large temperature hysteresis of a structural transition in metal-organic frameworks. We also note that the transition from the open to closed structure at low temperature shows very slow kinetics. An ab initio computer simulation is employed to investigate the possible mechanism of the transition.},
