  abstract = {Negative gas adsorption by a porous crystalline solid, DUT-49, observed by spontaneous desorption of gas during a pressure increase raises fundamental questions on the physical origin of this puzzling behavior. Importantly, a framework that can transform a large amount of strain into pressure has many possible technological applications. To address this question, we studied the mechanics and thermodynamics of DUT-49 at both the molecular unit and framework scales by applying quantum density functional theory and extensive classical molecular-dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that negative gas adsorption originates from molecular buckling of the organic structural unit and thus allows a colossal framework transformation. Methane adsorption is subsequently shown to activate this transition, in full agreement with experimental observations. The molecular insight presented here unveils the mechanics and thermodynamics responsible for negative gas adsorption and provides unparalleled understanding to aid the discovery of new examples of similarly responsive porous metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Adsorption-based phenomena are important in gas separations1, 2, such as the treatment of greenhouse-gas3 and toxic-gas4 pollutants, and in water-adsorption-based heat pumps5 for solar cooling systems. The ability to tune the pore size, shape and functionality of crystalline porous coordination polymers\textemdash{}or metal\textendash{}organic frameworks (MOFs)\textemdash{}has made them attractive materials for such adsorption-based applications3, 6, 7, 8. The flexibility and guest-molecule-dependent response9, 10 of MOFs give rise to unexpected and often desirable adsorption phenomena11, 12, 13, 14. Common to all isothermal gas adsorption phenomena, however, is increased gas uptake with increased pressure. Here we report adsorption transitions in the isotherms of a MOF (DUT-49) that exhibits a negative gas adsorption; that is, spontaneous desorption of gas (methane and n-butane) occurs during pressure increase in a defined temperature and pressure range. A combination of in situ powder X-ray diffraction, gas adsorption experiments and simulations shows that this adsorption behaviour is controlled by a sudden hysteretic structural deformation and pore contraction of the MOF, which releases guest molecules. These findings may enable technologies using frameworks capable of negative gas adsorption for pressure amplification in micro- and macroscopic system engineering. Negative gas adsorption extends the series of counterintuitive phenomena such as negative thermal expansion15, 16 and negative refractive indices17 and may be interpreted as an adsorptive analogue of force-amplifying negative compressibility transitions proposed for metamaterials18},
