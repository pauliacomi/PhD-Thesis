\section{Results and discussion}

The first part of this section will present the characteristics of the
\gls{NGA} step in DUT-49 as recorded by ambient calorimetry, 
and what a cursory examination of the isotherm and enthalpy
curves at \SI{303}{\kelvin} can reveal about the energetics of the 
system and the stability of the two phases.

The following subsection contains the results of the studies on 
DUT-49 analogues, highlighting the effects that linker elongation
and functionalization have on the adsorption behaviour and \gls{NGA}
extent at ambient temperature.

Finally, an in-depth study of the DUT-49 \gls{NGA} mechanism is performed,
employing a variety of gas probes (\ce{N2, Ar, O2, CO}) at low temperature.
The time-resolved data obtained through continuous adsorbate introduction
sheds light on the influence of the host-guest and guest-guest interactions
on transition mechanics, the energetic barrier of the transition state
and on system kinetics. A comparison with non-flexible analogues allows
an assessment of the role of the pore filling mechanism on the structural
transition to be made.
