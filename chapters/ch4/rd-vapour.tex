\subsection{Vapour adsorption}

The effects of shaping with \(\rho\)-alumina are 
so far more subtle than the changes encountered when using 
PVA, as shown in the corresponding 
study~\cite{chanutObservingEffectsShaping2016}.
As such we extended the characterisation using adsorption
of vapours at room temperature.
The influence of the binder on hydrophobic character of the
material may be of interest for tuning the properties of the 
beads. Here, the adsorption isotherms of water and methanol
can serve as a probe for small changes is surface properties.
To this end, the same PVA samples which were 
used in the previous study were investigated alongside 
the MRA-shaped MOF.

Due to its surface charges, alumina is a 
hydrophilic substance, with a contact 
angle of \SI{10}{\degree}. It is expected that its 
addition will therefore increase the affinity 
of the resulting pellet towards water. On the other hand,
the PVA binder is more hydrophobic, with a water contact
angle of \SI{51}{\degree}. The medium affinity for water
is due to the surface hydroxyl functionalizations, which
can lead to hydrogen bonding.

Two indicators may highlight changes in material hydrophilicity: 
adsorption in the low relative pressure region (\(p/p^0 < 0.3\)) and 
condensation steps in the isotherm. The adsorption at low
pressures is representative of the first interactions with the 
surface, as explained in the previous sections. The pressure 
at which condensation occurs in the pores of the material, or 
where a sharp isotherm increase is seen depends on the 
size of the pore, but also on pore environment and 
guest-guest interactions.

The measured isotherms on water and methanol can be found
in \autoref{shaping:fgr:wateradsorption} 
and \autoref{shaping:fgr:methanoladsorption} respectively.
Initial Henry constants have been calculated for the isotherms
using the initial point method.

\subsubsection{UiO-66(Zr)}

On UiO-66(Zr), the water isotherm shows a slow uptake at the 
start, corresponding to a hydrophobic material and then shows 
a small step at \(p/p^0 = 0.3\). Complete pore filling happens 
at \(p/p^0 = 0.8\).

\subsubsection{MIL-100(Fe)}

Water isotherms on MIL-100(Fe) show a more hydrophilic environment,
with a higher initial uptake, and two condensation steps at 
\(p/p^0 = 0.3\) and \(p/p^0 = 0.5\). There is pronounced 
hysteresis on the desorption branch.
The methanol adsorption isotherms also show a two step adsorption
isotherm, but without any hysteresis present. The shaped samples 
also show a lower

\subsubsection{Conclusion of vapour adsorption study}

It can be therefore concluded that overall, the addition of either 
binder has not influenced the behaviour towards water or 
methanol for the materials studied.
