Polymers possess a variety of unique attributes, such as softness, thermal and chemical stability, and optoelectrical properties that can be integrated with MOFs to make hybrids with sophisticated architectures. Hybridization of MOFs and polymers is producing new and versatile materials that exhibit peculiar properties hard to realize with the individual components. This review article focuses on the methodology for hybridization of MOFs and polymers, as well as the intriguing functions of hybrid materials.},

  abstract = {The separation of related molecules with similar physical/chemical properties is of prime industrial importance and practically entails a substantial energy penalty, typically necessitating the operation of energy-demanding low temperature fractional distillation techniques. Certainly research efforts, in academia and industry alike, are ongoing with the main aim to develop advanced functional porous materials to be adopted as adsorbents for the effective and energy-efficient separation of various important commodities. Of special interest is the subclass of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with pore aperture sizes below 5-7 A, namely ultra-microporous MOFs, which in contrast to conventional zeolites and activated carbons show great prospects for addressing key challenges in separations pertaining to energy and environmental sustainability, specifically materials for carbon capture and separation of olefin/paraffin, acetylene/ethylene, linear/branched alkanes, xenon/krypton, etc. In this tutorial review we discuss the latest developments in ultra-microporous MOF adsorbents and their use as separating agents via thermodynamics and/or kinetics and molecular sieving. Appreciably, we provide insights into the distinct microscopic mechanisms governing the resultant separation performances, and suggest a plausible correlation between the inherent structural features/topology of MOFs and the associated gas/vapour separation performance.},

It is possible to classify materials with different trends in CO2 uptake with varying amounts of pre-adsorbed water, including cases in which an increase in CO2 uptake is observed for samples with a given amount of pre-adsorbed water. Comparing loss in CO2 uptake between ``wet'' and ``dry'' samples with the Henry constant calculated from the water adsorption isotherm results in a semi-logarithmic trend for the majority of samples allowing predictions to be made. Outliers from this trend may be of particular interest and an explanation for the behaviour for each of the outliers is proposed. This thus leads to propositions for designing or choosing MOFs for CO2 capture in applications where humidity is present.},

The effect of pelletization on the adsorption of a series of gasses (N2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C3H6, C4H10) at 303 K was evidenced in the adsorption isotherms and the enthalpies of adsorption measured by using microcalorimetric analysis. As expected, uptakes of gas per gram of material were lower for the spheres than for the powder. However, taking into account the bulk density, this tendency was inverted, suggesting that the spherical materials are of distinct interest for gas-based applications. Nevertheless, other effects including partial pore restriction and active site ``protection'' may equally be evidenced for some pelletized materials, suggesting that the polyvinyl binder may play a more complex role.},

  abstract = {The present work shows how gas adsorption microcalorimetry is a particularly powerful experimental technique as it allows both an in depth examination of the surface state of adsorbents and a minute following of adsorption mechanisms such as phase changes and transitions. Several examples are thus given with zeolites and related materials which can be considered as model adsorbents showing the information that can be obtained at low temperature (77 K) and at room temperature. In the later sections, the increasing importance of modelling is highlighted as a tool to complete experiments and to gain a greater understanding of the microscopic mechanisms in play during adsorption phenomena. To cite this article: P. L. Llewellyn et al., C. R. Chimie 8 (2005). Nous montrons dans ce travail que la microcalorim\'etrie d'adsorption en phase gazeuse est une technique exp\'erimentale particuli\`erement pr\'ecieuse, parce qu'elle permet, d'une part, de conna\^itre l'\'etat de surface des adsorbants avec une r\'esolution tr\`es fine et, d'autre part, de suivre minutieusement les m\'ecanismes d'adsorption mis en jeu ainsi que les \'eventuelles transitions de phases des adsorbants. Plusieurs exemples sont ainsi fournis sur l'\'etude de mat\'eriaux mod\`eles : les z\'eolithes et les mat\'eriaux apparent\'es, en soulignant quelles sont les informations qui peuvent \^etre extraites, soit \`a basse temp\'erature (77 K), soit \`a temp\'erature ambiante. Dans la derni\`ere partie, nous soulignons l'importance accrue de la mod\'elisation afin de compl\'eter l'outil exp\'erimental et de mieux cerner les m\'ecanismes microscopiques mis en jeu dans les ph\'enom\`enes d'adsorption.

  abstract = {Porous crystals are strategic materials with industrial applications within petrochemistry, catalysis, gas storage, and selective separation. Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character. However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect. New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare. Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability. The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates. The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications. The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.},

  abstract = {In addition to its high thermal stability, repetitive hydration/dehydration tests have revealed that the porous zirconium terephthalate UiO-66 switches reversibly between its dehydroxylated and hydroxylated versions. The structure of its dehydroxylated form has thus been elucidated by coupling molecular simulations and X-ray powder diffraction data. Infrared measurements have shown that relatively weak acid sites are available while microcalorimetry combined with Monte Carlo simulations emphasize moderate interactions between the UiO-66 surface and a wide range of guest molecules including CH(4), CO, and CO(2). These properties, in conjunction with its significant adsorption capacity, make UiO-66 of interest for its further evaluation for CO(2) recovery in industrial applications. This global approach suggests a strategy for the evaluation of metal-organic frameworks for gas-based applications.},
