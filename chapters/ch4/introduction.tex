\section{Introduction}

An adsorbent cannot be used in an industrial process in its raw powder form. 
The small crystals which are normally the synthesis product of such a material
would not be suited for direct use and need to be transformed into hierarchically
porous structures.

Therefore, adsorbents are usually shaped into pellets, a process which introduces a
range of benefits, such as improved flow regimes, better thermal management
and material containment. The shaping process is needed not just for stabilising
the small particles, but also to impart the resulting pellet with a high
enough mechanical resistance to withstand the stresses imposed by the high flow
encountered in an industrial bed.

The shaping process is therefore a crucial step towards the large-scale
use of an adsorbent material. Even for commonplace adsorbents such as 
carbons and zeolites, the optimum binding compound and the shaping
process itself are the subject of extensive research. Often, the 
procedure is tailored for individual material and application.

In an ideal setting, the process has limited effects on the properties
of the material. However, this is often not the case, as shaping can degrade 
or improve adsorption performance. After a short introduction to shaping, 
this chapter explores the variability introduced by the binder in three topical MOFs: 
UiO-66(Zr), MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-127(Fe), which have been selected for their good
stability and well-studied adsorption behaviour.
The alumina shaped variant of these MOFs is compared to the original powder material,
with regard to the adsorption of a series of common gasses and vapours.
Microcalorimetry in conjunction with 8 gas probes has been used to get an in-depth 
picture of the change in surface energetics, with a separate study of adsorption of 
water and methanol vapour to examine changes in hydrophobicity.
Particular behaviours are then highlighted and discussed.

Finally, a previous study on the same materials shaped with a poly-vinyl
alcohol (PVA) binder is extended to vapour adsorption and the entire dataset is 
processed to obtain an overview of the impact of a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic binder
on adsorption performance.
