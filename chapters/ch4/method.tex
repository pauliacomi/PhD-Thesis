\section{Materials, shaping and characterisation methods}

\subsection{Materials}

In this chapter the same series of ``topical'' \glspl{MOF} was selected and
used to investigate the influence of a different shaping method, namely
the use of an alumina binder, on their adsorption properties.

The UiO-66(Zr) \gls{MOF} and its derivatives are well known due to their
stability, both in regards to temperature and chemical
compounds~\cite{cavkaNewZirconiumInorganic2008} and has been
discussed in detail in \autoref{def}. It is composed of
Zr6-oxo clusters which are connected with \gls{BDC} linkers 
to form a face-centered cubic framework. It has
shown promise~\cite{wiersumEvaluationUiO66GasBased2011}
in use for gas adsorption applications. It contains a
three-dimensional arrangement of micropores with each centric
octahedral cage surrounded by eight corner tetrahedral cages
(diameters of approximately \SI{1.1}{\nano\metre} and \SI{0.8}{\nano\metre}
respectively) and connected through narrow triangular windows
of approximately \SI{0.6}{\nano\metre}.

MIL-100(Fe) is a \gls{MOF} which uses the \gls{BTC}
in conjunction with trimeric iron (III) octahedral
clusters~\cite{horcajadaSynthesisCatalyticProperties2007,%
	YangWaterStableMetalOrganic2013}.
The framework assembles in hybrid supertetrahedra which leads to very
large pores: a \SI{2.5}{\nano\metre} cage and a larger, \SI{2.9}{\nano\metre}
cage. These pore cages are accessible through windows of
\SI{0.55}{\nano\metre} and \SI{0.86}{\nano\metre} respectively.
The iron trimers are coordinated with
anions and have shown a propensity to partially reduce to a divalent
\ce{Fe^2+} state, exposing an open metal \gls{CUS} in the
process~\cite{yoonControlledReducibilityMetalOrganic2010}.

The last material, MIL-127(Fe), originally reported
by~\citet{liuAssemblyMetalOrganic2007} is a \gls{MOF} built from the same
metal (III) octahedra trimers as MIL-100(Fe), but using the
3,3',5,5'-azobenzenetetracarboxylate (TazBz) linker, to produce a
framework with the \textbf{soc} topology. This material has shown
promise~\cite{chevreauSynthesisBiocompatibleHighly2016}
for large scale synthesis. Furthermore, due to its alternating
hydrophobic/hydrophilic microporous system, it has been shown to be
of interest for multiple applications such as catalysis or
\ce{CO2} capture~\cite{chanutScreeningEffectWater2017}.

Complete details of the synthesis method for all materials 
can be found in the related
publication~\cite{valekarShapingPorousMetal2017}
and in \autoref{appx:synthesis}.
The structures of the three \gls{MOF} can be seen
in \autoref{shaping:fig:mofstructures}.

\subsection{Shaping Procedure}

The shaping of the samples was performed
using a wet granulation method. In the case of the alumina binder,
the \gls{MOF} powder was was mixed with the previously prepared mesoporous
\(\rho\)-alumina with water added as the dispersing medium. For the
\gls{PVA} binder, the \gls{MOF} powder was instead added to a solution of
ethanol solution containing a polymer mixture of polyvinyl groups
such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl butyral. The resulting
mixture was shaped into beads using a hand-made pan granulator.
During the process, the spheres were sprayed with the respective
solvent in order to achieve desired size. The beads were then sieved
and rolled using a roller machine to enhance their spherical
shape. Finally, the prepared samples were dried at \SI{303}{\kelvin}
for \SI{12}{\hour} to remove all residual solvent.
The resulting beads were near spherical in shape, with a diameter
between \SIrange{2}{2.5}{\milli\metre}. More details regarding the
granulation method can be found in the respective 
publications~\cite{chevreauSynthesisBiocompatibleHighly2016,%
chanutObservingEffectsShaping2016}.

\subsection{Characterisation of powders and pellets}

The primary interest of the study was observing differences
in adsorption properties between the powder and the shaped materials.

Thermogravimetric analysis was used to verify that the binder
did not change the thermal stability of the materials and, in the
case of the \gls{PVA} variant, to ensure that the activation temperature
chosen did not induce polymer decomposition. The \gls{TGA} methodology
is described in detail in \autoref{appx:char:TGA} of \autoref{appx:char}.

The bulk and skeletal density of the powder and pellets were measured
to allow isotherms to be presented on a volume basis, as well as
to check the level of densification afforded through the
shaping process. The procedure is described in \autoref{appx:char:bulkdensity}
and \autoref{appx:char:truedensity} of \autoref{appx:char}.

Specific surface area and pore volume were determined through
nitrogen adsorption at \SI{77}{\kelvin}. These measurements were
recorded according to the method in \autoref{appx:char:N2phys}.
For inspecting changes in surface hydrophobicity, water and
methanol adsorption isotherms were measured according to
the method presented in \autoref{appx:char:vapourphys}.

Finally, all calorimetry data was recorded using a high sensitivity
Tian-Calvet calorimeter coupled with adsorption manometry, as
introduced in \autoref{calo}.

\subsection{Sample activation for adsorption}

The materials were pre-treated before all adsorption experiments by
activation at high temperature under secondary vacuum for 16 hours.
The activation temperature was specific
to each solid: \SI{200}{\degreeCelsius} for UiO-66(Zr),
\SI{150}{\degreeCelsius} for MIL-100(Fe) and \SI{150}{\degreeCelsius}
for MIL-127(Fe).
