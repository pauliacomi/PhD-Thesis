\subsection{Crystalinity of leached samples}\label{def:xrd}

The crystalinity of the leached samples is verified through 
XRD. Figure x \todo{} confirms that all resulting materials
retain the same peaks in their powder diffraction patterns.

A closer look at the low angle scattering reveals the 
appearance of diffuse peaks, corresponding to forbidden
reflections of the (\textbf{reo}) phase. They confirm that the 
leached samples begin to exhibit phase coexistence of 
the original UiO-66(Zr) unit cell and the missing cluster
(\textbf{reo}) net.
