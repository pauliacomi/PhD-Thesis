\section{Introduction}

The UiO-66(Zr) MOF and its derivatives are well known due to their thermal and chemical 
stability~\cite{cavkaNewZirconiumInorganic2008}. It is composed of
\ce{[Zr6O4(OH)4]^12+} clusters which are connected with benzene dicarboxilate (BDC) linkers to form
a face-centered cubic framework. It has shown promise~\cite{wiersumEvaluationUiO66GasBased2011}
in use for gas adsorption and catalytic applications.
