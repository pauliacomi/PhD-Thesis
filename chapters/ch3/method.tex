\section{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Materials}

The UiO-66(Zr) MOF used in this study was synthesised according
to the procedure described in \autoref{appx:synthesis:uio66def}.
This particular method was chosen to ensure that a structure with
a minimal number of intrinsic defects would be obtained.

The material was then gestated in a solvent solution of modulator
through.

To generate a comprehensive map of all of the potential influence
of different variables on defect


\subsection{Methods for quantifying defects}

- X-ray diffraction
- TGA
-
