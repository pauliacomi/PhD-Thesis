  abstract = {The nanoporous and tunable nature of metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) has made them promising adsorbents for water adsorption applications such as water harvesting and adsorptive heat pumps. In these applications, water adsorption properties in MOFs play a crucial role. However, understanding their structural defects and how defects influence adsorption thermodynamics remains limited to date. In this work, by employing Monte Carlo techniques and first-principle density functional theory calculations, we investigate the effect of defects on the water adsorption properties in MOF-801 structures at an atomic level. Our calculations show that the adsorption isotherm in perfect MOF-801 (without defects) greatly deviates from that measured experimentally. With the introduction of defects with a high density, a reasonably good agreement can be achieved, suggesting that a high defect density in MOF-801 may be responsible for its hydrophilic adsorptive behaviors. Further, water adsorption properties in MOF-801 structures are found to depend on the spatial configuration of defects, and water condensation in nanoporous MOF-801 is identified to occur preferentially along the \langle{}110\rangle{} direction. Detailed structural characteristics (accessible volume, etc.) of MOF-801 structures and the adsorption energetics of water in the frameworks are also studied and correlated with the computed adsorption isotherms. Our findings reveal important insights into the role of defects, offering a microscopic picture to help facilitate the rational design of better MOFs for water adsorption applications.},

  abstract = {UiO-66 is an archetypal zirconium-based metal\textendash{}organic framework (MOF) that is constructed from hexanuclear zirconium oxide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs) and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (bdc) linkers. For the first time, a room-temperature solution-based synthesis is reported for UiO-66 and several of its derivatives, UiO-66-X (X = NH2, OH, or NO2), resulting in materials that are as porous and crystalline as those made at elevated temperatures. In addition, via modulation of the temperature at which UiO-66 is synthesized, the number of defect sites can be varied. It was found through N2 sorption isotherm analysis and potentiometric acid\textendash{}base titrations that increasing the synthesis temperature from 25 to 130 $^\circ$C results in a systematic decrease in the number of defect sites in UiO-66. The results suggest that, with respect to this synthetic procedure, a maximal number of defect sites is achieved [$\sim$1.3 missing linkers per Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc)6] at a temperature of 45 $^\circ$C.},

The defect showed strong dependence on the nature of the modulator acid used in the MOF synthesis; the defects, in turn, were found to correlate with the MOF physical and chemical properties. The dynamic nature of the Zr6 (node)-monocarboxylate bond showed promise in defect functionalization and "healing", including the formation of X-ray-quality "defect-free" UiO-67 single crystals.

Since the development of the field in its current form more than two decades ago, priority has been placed on the synthesis of new structures. However, more recently, a clear trend has emerged in shifting the emphasis from material design to exploring the chemical and physical properties of structures already known. In particular, although such nanoporous materials were traditionally seen as rigid crystalline structures, there is growing evidence that large-scale flexibility, the presence of defects and long-range disorder are not the exception in metal-organic frameworks, but the rule. Here we offer some perspective into how these concepts are perhaps inescapably intertwined, highlight recent advances in our understanding and discuss how a consideration of the interfaces between them may lead to enhancements of the materials' functionalities.},

In contrast, the unique prospects these porous and crystalline materials offer for application in electronic devices, although actively developed, are often underexposed. This review highlights the research aimed at the implementation of MOFs as an integral part of solid-state microelectronics. Manufacturing these devices will critically depend on the compatibility of MOFs with existing fabrication protocols and predominant standards. Therefore, it is important to focus in parallel on a fundamental understanding of the distinguishing properties of MOFs and eliminating fabrication-related obstacles for integration. The latter implies a shift from the microcrystalline powder synthesis in chemistry labs, towards film deposition and processing in a cleanroom environment. Both the fundamental and applied aspects of this two-pronged approach are discussed. Critical directions for future research are proposed in an updated high-level roadmap to stimulate the next steps towards MOF-based microelectronics within the community.},

  abstract = {Tailoring defects in Metal-Organic Frameworks is important for enhancing sorption and reactive properties. Defects in UiO-66 have been characterized for the first time by using water adsorption measurements. We find that the defect induced hydrophilicity, quantitatively expressed by the Henry constant and the saturation water uptake, correlates well with the catalytic performance in the cyanosilylation of benzaladehyde. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of materials that offer ample opportunities in the research areas of catalysis, gas adsorption, gas separation and related fields. 1\textendash{}4 MOFs are porous materials composed of interconnecting inorganic and organic moieties 5,6 which can be tuned to meet certain requirements. 7 For instance, by varying the organic linker many different structures with tuneable inner pore volumes, e.g. micro or mesoporosity, can be obtained. 8 Initially, MOFs have gained a lot of attention in the context of gas-storage applications; however, their thermal and chemical stability have limited possible (industrial) applications so far. 9,10 A step forward in this context has been made with Zr based MOFs, e.g. UiO-66 and PCN-222, 11\textendash{}13 which are stable in most chemical solvents with decomposition temperatures as high as 400 $^\circ$C. 14 When dealing with crystalline materials, defects and disorder are steady companions at temperatures above 0 K. Recently it was recognised that defects can be used to alter properties in MOFs, especially their catality activity and sorption behaviour. 15\textendash{}20 For instance, (defective) Zr-based MOFs have been used as Lewis acid catalysts in various reactions, including Meerwein reduction, 21 esterification, 22 hydrogenation of aromatic compounds, 23 epoxide ring-opening reaction and others. 19 Despite the large interest of the community in this field, there is a current debate on which is the most effective set of experiments to determine the nature of defects, e.g. concentration, type of defects and their chemistry. Our work follows on from the important findings of Vermootele 21 and Wu, 24 who used different modulators, e.g. acetic acid (AA) and tri fluoro acetic acid (TFA) for the incorporation of defects in UiO-66. Here, we use varying amounts of AA and TFA as modulators to prepare UiO-66 samples with an increasing amount of defects. 21,24,25 Subsequently, water sorption measurements were performed to elucidate the chemistry of the incorporated defects, in particular their hydrophilicity which can be directly linked to their Lewis acidity. Additionnaly, we use the cyanosiylation of benzaldehyde as catalytic},

  abstract = {UiO-66 is a highly important prototypical zirconium metal-organic framework (MOF) compound because of its excellent stabilities not typically found in common porous MOFs. In its perfect crystal structure, each Zr metal center is fully coordinated by 12 organic linkers to form a highly connected framework. Using high-resolution neutron power diffraction technique, we found the first direct structural evidence showing that real UiO-66 material contains significant amount of missing-linker defects, an unusual phenomenon for MOFs. The concentration of the missing-linker defects is surprisingly high, $\sim$10\% in our sample, effectively reducing the framework connection from 12 to $\sim$11. We show that by varying the concentration of the acetic acid modulator and the synthesis time, the linker vacancies can be tuned systematically, leading to dramatically enhanced porosity. We obtained samples with pore volumes ranging from 0.44 to 1.0 cm(3)/g and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas ranging from 1000 to 1600 m(2)/g, the largest values of which are $\sim$150\% and $\sim$60\% higher than the theoretical values of defect-free UiO-66 crystal, respectively. The linker vacancies also have profound effects on the gas adsorption behaviors of UiO-66, in particular CO2. Finally, comparing the gas adsorption of hydroxylated and dehydroxylated UiO-66, we found that the former performs systematically better than the latter (particularly for CO2) suggesting the beneficial effect of the -OH groups. This finding is of great importance because hydroxylated UiO-66 is the practically more relevant, non-air-sensitive form of this MOF. The preferred gas adsorption on the metal center was confirmed by neutron diffraction measurements, and the gas binding strength enhancement by the -OH group was further supported by our first-principles calculations.},

  abstract = {Adsorptive separation is very important in industry. Generally, the process uses porous solid materials such as zeolites, activated carbons, or silica gels as adsorbents. With an ever increasing need for a more efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally benign procedure for gas separation, adsorbents with tailored structures and tunable surface properties must be found. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by metal-containing nodes connected by organic bridges, are such a new type of porous materials. They are promising candidates as adsorbents for gas separations due to their large surface areas, adjustable pore sizes and controllable properties, as well as acceptable thermal stability. This critical review starts with a brief introduction to gas separation and purification based on selective adsorption, followed by a review of gas selective adsorption in rigid and flexible MOFs. Based on possible mechanisms, selective adsorptions observed in MOFs are classified, and primary relationships between adsorption properties and framework features are analyzed. As a specific example of tailor-made MOFs, mesh-adjustable molecular sieves are emphasized and the underlying working mechanism elucidated. In addition to the experimental aspect, theoretical investigations from adsorption equilibrium to diffusion dynamics via molecular simulations are also briefly reviewed. Furthermore, gas separations in MOFs, including the molecular sieving effect, kinetic separation, the quantum sieving effect for H2/D2 separation, and MOF-based membranes are also summarized (227 references).},

  abstract = {Porous crystals are strategic materials with industrial applications within petrochemistry, catalysis, gas storage, and selective separation. Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character. However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect. New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare. Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability. The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates. The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications. The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.},

Moreover, when defects are present in the structure of these MOFs, coordinatively unsaturated Zr ions with Lewis acid properties are created, which increase the catalytic activity of the resulting defective solids. In the present work, molecular modeling techniques combined with new experimental data on various defective hydrated and dehydrated materials allow to unravel the nature and role of defective active sites in the Fischer esterification and the role of coordinated water molecules to provide additional Br\o{}nsted sites. Periodic models of UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 catalysts have been used to unravel the reaction mechanism on hydrated and dehydrated materials. Various adsorption modes of water and methanol are investigated. The proposed mechanisms are in line with experimental observations that amino groups yield a reduction in the reaction barriers, although they have a passive role in modulating the electronic structure of the material. Water has a beneficial role on the reaction cycle by providing extra Br\o{}nsted sites and by providing stabilization for various intermediates through hydrogen bonds.},

Among the most fascinating and pervasive features of this material are defects, and their influence on a multitude of its properties. However, the simultaneous occurrence of two defect types, missing linkers and missing nodes, limits the extent to which certain material properties can be accurately matched to the framework's defect structure. In this contribution, we present a strategy to unequivocally create missing linker defects in UiO66, by first synthesizing terephthalate frameworks doped with a thermolabile linker, trans-1,4-cyclohexane-dicarboxylate (cdc), followed by postsynthetic thermal decomposition of the latter. Characterization of the mixed-linker materials before and after cdc removal by powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, N2 physisorption, and NMR spectroscopy confirmed a homogeneous distribution of cdc, and thus also of the formed defects, throughout the materials. The UiO-66 structure is shown to tolerate up to 4.3 missing linker defects per [Zr6O4(OH)4]12+ node, with higher defect densities compromising the framework's structural integrity and porosity. Importantly, no increase in specific surface area was seen after additional missing linker defects were formed, providing compelling evidence that high porosity often observed in modulated UiO-66 samples should rather be attributed to missing cluster defects.},

Samples of UiO66 having different degrees of defectivity were exchanged using solutions of several terephthalic acid analogues in a range of conditions. Linker exchange only occurred in defect-free UiO-66, whereas monocarboxylates grafted at defective sites were found to be preferentially exchanged with respect to terephthalic acid over the whole range of conditions investigated. A 1:1 exchange ratio between the terephthalic acid analogue and modulator was observed, providing evidence that the defects had missing-cluster nature. Ex situ characterisation of the MOF powders after exchange corroborated these findings and evidenced that the physical-chemical properties of the MOF depend on whether the functionalisation occurs at defective sites or on the framework. N2 sorption analysis showed that, upon exchange, defective samples underwent significant decrease of surface area and disappearance of large pores, associated with the presence of missing-cluster defects in the starting material. CO2 sorption studies displayed the different impact of pure defect functionalisation and pure framework functionalisation on isosteric heat of adsorption and CO2/N2 selectivity.},

  abstract = {Defect engineering in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is an emerging strategy that can be used to control physical or chemical characteristics of MOFs, including adsorption behavior and textural, mechanical, and conductive properties. Understanding the impact of defects on textural properties and chemical stability of MOFs is imperative to the development of MOFs with tunable defect sites. In this work, systematic adsorption measurements were performed with three adsorbate molecules (SO2, benzene, and cyclohexane) to investigate changes in the pore size of defective UiO-66. Compared to the parent UiO-66, the defective UiO-66 shows significant changes in adsorption capacities among the selected adsorbate molecules, demonstrating that pore size is significantly enlarged by the missing cluster defects. BET surface area analysis and DFT calculations were also performed to interrogate the chemical stability of the defective MOFs after exposure to water and acidic environments. This work shows that pore size can be tuned as a function of defect concentration. Further, it is shown that the structural incorporation of trifluoroacetate groups in defective UiO-66 leads to an increase in average pore size without sacrificing chemical stability toward water and acidic species. The results of this work advance the understanding of textural properties and chemical stability of defect-engineered MOFs and also suggest a preparation method for synthesizing defective but stable MOFs.},
