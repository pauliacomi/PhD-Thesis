The crystalinity of the leached samples is verified through 
XRD. The results in \autoref{appx:def:xrd} confirm that all 
resulting materials retain the same peaks in their powder
diffraction patterns.

A closer look at the low angle scattering (\autoref{def:fig:xrd-defects})
reveals the appearance of diffuse peaks, which are marked in the 
figure by black arrows, which correspond to forbidden
reflections of the (\textbf{reo}) phase. They confirm that the 
leached samples begin to exhibit phase coexistence of 
the original UiO-66(Zr) unit cell and the missing cluster
(\textbf{reo}) net. These peaks have the highest intensity in 
the TFA treated materials, suggesting that it has the highest 
capability of introducing missing cluster defects.
