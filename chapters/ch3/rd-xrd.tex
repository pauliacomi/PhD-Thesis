The crystalinity of the leached samples is verified through 
XRD. The results, in \todo{fig} confirm that all resulting materials
retain the same peaks in their powder diffraction patterns.

A closer look at the low angle scattering (\autoref{def:fgr:xrd-defects})
reveals the appearance of diffuse peaks, corresponding to forbidden
reflections of the (\textbf{reo}) phase. They confirm that the 
leached samples begin to exhibit phase coexistence of 
the original UiO-66(Zr) unit cell and the missing cluster
(\textbf{reo}) net.
