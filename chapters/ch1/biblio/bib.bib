This method is more exact theoretically as well as practically than previously described methods. An average potential function has been determined inside the slit-like pores. With the help of this function the doubtful use of the Kelvin equation can be avoided at the scale of molecular dimensions. The method gives poor values for the larger pores but can be combined with the well-known Dollimore-Heal method at a pore size of 1.34 nm. Calculation is possible over a wide range of pore sizes. The calculation is shown through two examples from N2 isotherms at 77.4K. The model can be extended to other pore shapes as well as to other adsorbent-adsorbate pairs.},

Alternatively, pyIAST can use numerical quadrature to compute the spreading pressure for IAST calculations by interpolating the pure-component isotherm data. pyIAST can also perform reverse IAST calculations, where one seeks the required gas phase composition to yield a desired adsorbed phase composition.

This paper shows the effect upon the distribution results produced by changing the method for the calculation of t.

From this comparison and an examination of the smoothness of the distribution curve, the expression for t in picometers (pm) given by de Boer: t = 354 - 5 ln P Po1 3 is recommended. ?? 1970.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of the calculated micropore size of zeolite Y in a fluidized cracking catalyst based on empirical models for argon adsorption has been tested by examining the effect of curvature and by systematically verifying the magnitude of physical constants in the model equations. With a consistent set of physical parameters the slit model provided a pore size value of 0.45 nm, while the new cylindrical models provided values of 0.69 and 0.74 nm. The latter values are found to correspond well with the known aperture size of zeolite Y, 0.74 nm. By separately varying the magnitudes of five of the physical constants in the model over a range of $\pm$30\%, it was concluded that the diameter of the oxide ion at the surface had a large effect on the calculated pore size, while the other parameters had only moderate to small effects. Preliminary application of the cylindrical pore model to isotherms of argon on other zeolites and molecular sieves leads to promising results, especially for medium to large pore zeolites. These results suggest that the cylindrical pore model is a useful means for the transformation of argon adsorption data on a zeolite into a micropore size distribution.},

  abstract = {Porous crystals are strategic materials with industrial applications within petrochemistry, catalysis, gas storage, and selective separation. Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character. However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect. New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare. Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability. The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates. The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications. The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.},

Infrared measurements have shown that relatively weak acid sites are available while microcalorimetry combined with Monte Carlo simulations emphasize moderate interactions between the UiO-66 surface and a wide range of guest molecules including CH(4), CO, and CO(2). These properties, in conjunction with its significant adsorption capacity, make UiO-66 of interest for its further evaluation for CO(2) recovery in industrial applications.

It h a s been proven t h a t most of the known and widely-used isotherm equations are, from thermodynamic standpoint, incorrect. The first aim of UI is, with help of the differential equation t\textasciitilde{}(O), to t r a n s f o r m the incorrect r e l a t i o n s h i p s into correct ones. The second aim is to derive new and correct isotherm equations applicable for practical and theoretical purposes. The third practical applicability of UI is that it provides an exact method to choose the appropriate and correct isotherm equation for describing measured isotherms. The most important role of UI is in the calculations of the specific surface a r e a (a s) from m e a s u r e d i s o t h e r m s of Type I and II. The UI modifies our old models (Langmuir, Fowler-Guggenheim, Sips, Jovanovich, Volmer, deBoer-Hill, BET etc.) applicable to calculate the specific surface area. This modification has two important consequences. The first one means that in the isotherm equations a new p a r a m e t e r , \textasciitilde, a p p e a r s and it has g r e a t influence on t h e value of a s. The second one m e a n s t h a t with help of function t\textasciitilde{}(pr) one can d i s t i n g u i s h t h e m o n o l a y e r a n d multi|ayer domains in isotherms of Type I and II. Furthermore, the uniform interpretation needs a new model, so-called "cloud model", for interpretation of multilayer adsorption. This model has important theoretical and practical differences in comparison to the well-known BET t h e o r y and also provides new possibility to exact calculations o f a s. Based on the UI it is possible to calculate the mixed gas adsorption from the pure isotherms measured on heterogeneous surfaces and to qualify industrial adsorbents for practical use. As a consequence of UI it was possible to define the theorem of "referable states" of two dimensional layers (gases) wich corresponds to the "corresponding states" of threedimensional gases. Shortly summarized: the uniform interpretation proposed in this review modifies our old views of classic models of physical adsorption.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, researchers have developed a number of empirical and theoretical models for the correlation and prediction of the thermophysical properties of pure fluids and mixtures treated as pseudo-pure fluids. In this paper, a survey of all the state-of-the-art formulations of thermophysical properties is presented. The most-accurate thermodynamic properties are obtained from multiparameter Helmholtz-energy-explicit-type formulations. For the transport properties, a wider range of methods has been employed, including the extended corresponding states method. All of the thermophysical property correlations described here have been implemented into CoolProp, an open-source thermophysical property library. This library is written in C++, with wrappers available for the majority of programming languages and platforms of technical interest. As of publication, 110 pure and pseudo-pure fluids are included in the library, as well as properties of 40 incompressible fluids and humid air. The source code for the CoolProp library is included as an electronic annex.},

  abstract = {A study has been made of the mechanisms of micropore filling with particular reference to the adsorptive properties of two samples of activated charcoal cloth, having predominantly narrow slit-shaped pores, and a coke-based carbon, having a wider distribution of micropores. Nitrogen adsorption data at 77 K have been analysed by use of the as-method and the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation. Integral heats of adsorption for a range of organic adsorptives have been derived from heat of immersion data in conjunction with physisorption data. The findings support the view that there are two distinctive mechanisms of micropore filling: (a) a primary process, which takes place at very low p/p$^\circ$ and involves enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate interactions and (b) a secondary process, which leads to a more gradual approach to the plateau of a Type I isotherm and is the result of co-operative effects associated with the filling of wider micropores (the supermicropores of Dubinin).},
