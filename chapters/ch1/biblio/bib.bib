  abstract = {Over the last few decades, researchers have developed a number of empirical and theoretical models for the correlation and prediction of the thermophysical properties of pure fluids and mixtures treated as pseudo-pure fluids. In this paper, a survey of all the state-of-the-art formulations of thermophysical properties is presented. The most-accurate thermodynamic properties are obtained from multiparameter Helmholtz-energy-explicit-type formulations. For the transport properties, a wider range of methods has been employed, including the extended corresponding states method. All of the thermophysical property correlations described here have been implemented into CoolProp, an open-source thermophysical property library. This library is written in C++, with wrappers available for the majority of programming languages and platforms of technical interest. As of publication, 110 pure and pseudo-pure fluids are included in the library, as well as properties of 40 incompressible fluids and humid air. The source code for the CoolProp library is included as an electronic annex.},

Several methods for calculating t, the thickness of an adsorbed layer, have been proposed, but all suffer from uncertainties and no one method can be taken to be universally applicable to all adsorbents. This paper shows the effect upon the distribution results produced by changing the method for the calculation of t. It is convenient, but not necessarily theoretically correct, to take a comparison of cumulative area and BET area as a basis for the choice of the best values for t. From this comparison and an examination of the smoothness of the distribution curve, the expression for t in picometers (pm) given by de Boer: t = 354 - 5 ln P Po1 3 is recommended. ?? 1970.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of the calculated micropore size of zeolite Y in a fluidized cracking catalyst based on empirical models for argon adsorption has been tested by examining the effect of curvature and by systematically verifying the magnitude of physical constants in the model equations. With a consistent set of physical parameters the slit model provided a pore size value of 0.45 nm, while the new cylindrical models provided values of 0.69 and 0.74 nm. The latter values are found to correspond well with the known aperture size of zeolite Y, 0.74 nm. By separately varying the magnitudes of five of the physical constants in the model over a range of $\pm$30\%, it was concluded that the diameter of the oxide ion at the surface had a large effect on the calculated pore size, while the other parameters had only moderate to small effects. Preliminary application of the cylindrical pore model to isotherms of argon on other zeolites and molecular sieves leads to promising results, especially for medium to large pore zeolites. These results suggest that the cylindrical pore model is a useful means for the transformation of argon adsorption data on a zeolite into a micropore size distribution.},

Infrared measurements have shown that relatively weak acid sites are available while microcalorimetry combined with Monte Carlo simulations emphasize moderate interactions between the UiO-66 surface and a wide range of guest molecules including CH(4), CO, and CO(2). These properties, in conjunction with its significant adsorption capacity, make UiO-66 of interest for its further evaluation for CO(2) recovery in industrial applications.

  abstract = {A new form of Gibbs equation includes the differential function tg(O) having the form tg(0) --- \textasciitilde{}g(pr) -- (O/pr)(dpr/dO) w h e r e pr is the relative equilibrium p r e s s u r e a n d \textregistered{} is the coverage. This relationship is the physical and mathematical base for a uniform interpret a t i o n (UI) of gas/solid physical adsorption. The function \textasciitilde{}g(O) is the relative free e n e r g y of the surface, therefore, it can be applied to define the thermodynamical correctness of adsorption isotherm equations. Two conditions of correctness have been defined. According to these conditions the change in the free energy of the surface must have finite values at O -\textasciitilde{} 0 and at pr \textasciitilde{} 1. It h a s been proven t h a t most of the known and widely-used isotherm equations are, from thermodynamic standpoint, incorrect. The first aim of UI is, with help of the differential equation t\textasciitilde{}(O), to t r a n s f o r m the incorrect r e l a t i o n s h i p s into correct ones. The second aim is to derive new and correct isotherm equations applicable for practical and theoretical purposes. The third practical applicability of UI is that it provides an exact method to choose the appropriate and correct isotherm equation for describing measured isotherms. The most important role of UI is in the calculations of the specific surface a r e a (a s) from m e a s u r e d i s o t h e r m s of Type I and II. The UI modifies our old models (Langmuir, Fowler-Guggenheim, Sips, Jovanovich, Volmer, deBoer-Hill, BET etc.) applicable to calculate the specific surface area. This modification has two important consequences. The first one means that in the isotherm equations a new p a r a m e t e r , \textasciitilde, a p p e a r s and it has g r e a t influence on t h e value of a s. The second one m e a n s t h a t with help of function t\textasciitilde{}(pr) one can d i s t i n g u i s h t h e m o n o l a y e r a n d multi|ayer domains in isotherms of Type I and II. Furthermore, the uniform interpretation needs a new model, so-called "cloud model", for interpretation of multilayer adsorption. This model has important theoretical and practical differences in comparison to the well-known BET t h e o r y and also provides new possibility to exact calculations o f a s. Based on the UI it is possible to calculate the mixed gas adsorption from the pure isotherms measured on heterogeneous surfaces and to qualify industrial adsorbents for practical use. As a consequence of UI it was possible to define the theorem of "referable states" of two dimensional layers (gases) wich corresponds to the "corresponding states" of threedimensional gases. Shortly summarized: the uniform interpretation proposed in this review modifies our old views of classic models of physical adsorption.},

  abstract = {Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) is a widely-used thermodynamic framework to readily predict mixed-gas adsorption isotherms from a set of pure-component adsorption isotherms. We present an open-source, user-friendly Python package, pyIAST, to perform IAST calculations for an arbitrary number of components. pyIAST supports several common analytical models to characterize the pure-component isotherms from experimental or simulated data. Alternatively, pyIAST can use numerical quadrature to compute the spreading pressure for IAST calculations by interpolating the pure-component isotherm data. pyIAST can also perform reverse IAST calculations, where one seeks the required gas phase composition to yield a desired adsorbed phase composition.

  abstract = {Porous crystals are strategic materials with industrial applications within petrochemistry, catalysis, gas storage, and selective separation. Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character. However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect. New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare. Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability. The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu3-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates. The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications. The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm2 of external pressure.},

Materials chemistry and related fields commonly report new materials with limited attention paid to reproducibility. Here, we describe methods that are well suited to assessing reproducibility in these fields via retrospective analysis of reported data. This concept is illustrated by an exhaustive analysis of a topic that has been the focus of thousands of published studies, gas adsorption in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. We show that for the well-studied case of CO2 adsorption there are only 15 of the thousands of known MOFs for which enough experiments have been reported to allow strong conclusions to be drawn about the reproducibility of these measurements. Our results have immediate implications for the characterization of gas adsorption in porous materials but, more importantly, demonstrate an approach to assessing reproducibility that will be widely applicable in materials chemistry.},

Nitrogen adsorption data at 77 K have been analysed by use of the as-method and the Dubinin-Radushkevich equation. Integral heats of adsorption for a range of organic adsorptives have been derived from heat of immersion data in conjunction with physisorption data. The findings support the view that there are two distinctive mechanisms of micropore filling: (a) a primary process, which takes place at very low p/p$^\circ$ and involves enhanced adsorbent-adsorbate interactions and (b) a secondary process, which leads to a more gradual approach to the plateau of a Type I isotherm and is the result of co-operative effects associated with the filling of wider micropores (the supermicropores of Dubinin).},

Based on a literature search and conversations with the carbon capture community, we review the current status of measurements, standards, and data for the three major carbon capture materials in use today: solvents, solid sorbents, and membranes. We highlight current measurement, standards and data activities aimed to advance the development and use of carbon capture materials and major research needs that are critical to meet if innovation in carbon capture materials is to be achieved. The review reveals that although adsorbents are considered to have great potential to reduce carbon capture cost, there is no consensus on the experimental parameters to be used for evaluating sorbent properties. Another important finding is the lack of in situ experimental tools for the structural characterization of solid porous materials during CO2 adsorption, and computational methods that would enable a materials-by-design approach for their development.},
