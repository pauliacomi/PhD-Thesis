\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter a framework for adsorption data processing is 
presented, which focuses on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item standardisation of the processing method of isotherms
    \item the ability to process large datasets 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

A

The other chapters in this thesis will explore the origin of some of
this variability, such as inherent defects in the material (\autoref{def})
form and processing (\autoref{shaping}) and of course, of unique behaviours
of MOFs such as flexibility arising from its building blocks (\autoref{dut})
