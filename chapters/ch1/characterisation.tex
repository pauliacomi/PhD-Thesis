\section{Characterisation of materials through adsorption}

Adsorption is a powerful tool for characterisation of materials.
As it can give insight into the surface properties of solids, it
is most often used for the investigation of porous or finely
divided materials where the surface area to volume ratio is 
high enough for adsorption to be detected with common laboratory 
measurement techniques such as volumetry and gravimetry (see 
\autoref{appx:char}). The most common properties which can
be obtained through adsorption methods are probe accessible 
surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution. Other 
characteristics such as surface chemistry or material response
can be probed through adsorption. Finally, pure component adsorption
isotherms can be used to predict multicomponent adsorption through
computational models such as IAST. The following section will go into
detail on how such methods are applied.
