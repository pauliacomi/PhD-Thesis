\subsection{Mathemathical descriptions of isotherms}%
\label{pyg:models}

A lot of effort was put into attempting to describe
the phenomenon of adsorption using a simple model.
Through a mathematical understanding, the underlying
mechanisms of adsorption can be understood.
Unfortunately, the plethora of isotherm
features and shapes can only be truly recreated
by molecular simulation, which requires an exact
knowledge of the adsorbent structure and its interaction
with the adsorbed gas.
Nevertheless, great strides have been taken to
obtain several models which can be useful
when fitted to measured isotherms
for obtaining simple parameters which are
representative of physical factors such as
guest-host interaction, surface area, pore size,
total pore volume and others.
More importantly, it allows us to numerically
compare measured isotherms.

A page of figures for different models with several
values of their parameter can be seen in
Figure~\ref{pyg:fgr:modelex}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Henry model}\label{pyg:models:henry}

The simplest method of describing adsorption on a
surface is Henry’s law. It assumes only interactions
with the adsorbate surface and is described by a
linear dependence of adsorbed amount with
increasing pressure.

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:henry}
	n_a(p) = K_H p
\end{equation}

It is derived from the Gibbs equation, by substituting a
a two dimensional analogue to the ideal gas law.
From a physical standpoint, Henry's law is unrealistic as adsorption sites
will saturate at higher pressures. However, the constant \(K_H\),
or Henry’s constant, can be thought of as a measure of the strength
of the interaction of the probe gas with the surface. At very
low concentrations of gas there is a
theoretical requirement for the applicability of Henry's law.
Therefore, most models reduce to Equation~\ref{pyg:eqn:henry}
as \(\lim_{p \to 0} n(p)\).

\subsubsection{Langmuir and multi-site Langmuir
	model}\label{pyg:models:langmuir}

The Langmuir theory~\cite{langmuirAdsorptionGasesPlane1918a},
proposed at the start of the 20th century, states that
adsorption takes place on specific sites on a surface, until
all sites are occupied.
It is derived from a kinetic model of gas adsorption and
is based on several assumptions:

\begin{itemize}

	\item All sites are equivalent and have the same chance of
	      being occupied.
	\item Each adsorbate molecule can occupy one adsorption site.
	\item There are no interactions between adsorbed molecules.
	\item The rates of adsorption and desorption are proportional
	      to the number
	      of sites currently free and currently occupied,
	      respectively.
	\item Adsorption is complete when all sites are filled.

\end{itemize}

Using these assumptions we can define rates for both adsorption and
desorption. The adsorption rate (Equation~\ref{pyg:eqn:langmuir_ads})
will be proportional to the number of sites available on the surface,
as well as the number of molecules in the gas, which is given by
pressure.
The desorption rate, on the other hand, will be proportional to the
number of occupied sites and the energy of adsorption
(Equation~\ref{pyg:eqn:langmuir_des}).
It is also useful to define \(\theta = n_a/n_a^m\) as the surface
coverage,
the number of sites occupied divided by the total sites. At
equilibrium,
the rate of adsorption and the rate of
desorption are equal, therefore the two equations can be combined.
The equation can then be arranged to obtain an expression for the
loading called the Langmuir Equation (\ref{pyg:eqn:langmuir}).

\begin{align}
	v_a                & = k_a p (1 - \theta) \label{pyg:eqn:langmuir_ads} \\
	v_d                & = k_d \theta \exp{\Big(-\frac{E}{RT}\Big)}
	\label{pyg:eqn:langmuir_des}                                           \\
	v_a                & = v_d                                             \\
	k_a p (1 - \theta) & = k_d \theta \exp{\Big(-\frac{E}{RT}\Big)}        \\
	n_a(p)             & = n_a^m \frac{Kp}{1+Kp} \label{pyg:eqn:langmuir}
\end{align}

The Langmuir constant \(K\)is the product of the individual
desorption
and adsorption constants \(k_a\) and \(k_d\) and exponentially
related to the energy of adsorption \(\exp{(-{E}/{RT})}\).

A common extension to the Langmuir model is to consider
the experimental isotherm to be the sum of several Langmuir-type
isotherms, each with specific maximum coverage and affinities.
The underlying assumption is that the adsorbent has several distinct
types of homogeneous adsorption sites and a Langmuir
equation is used for each. This is particularly
applicable in cases where the structure of the adsorbent
suggests that different types of sites are present,
such as in crystalline materials of variable chemistry like
zeolites and MOFs. The resulting isotherm equation is:

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:langmulti}
	n_a(p) = \sum_i n_{a,i}^m\frac{K_i p}{1+K_i p}
\end{equation}

In practice, only up to three adsorption sites are usually
considered.

\subsubsection{BET model}\label{pyg:models:bet}

The BET model~\cite{brunauerAdsorptionGasesMultimolecular1938}
assumes that adsorption takes place on the surface of the material in
incremental layers according to several assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The adsorption sites are equivalent, and therefore the
	      surface is heterogeneous.
	\item There are no lateral interactions between adsorbed
	      molecules.
	\item The adsorption takes place in layers, with adsorbed
	      molecules
	      acting as sites for the next layer.
\end{itemize}

A particular surface percentage \(\theta_x\) is occupied with
x layers. For each layer at equilibrium, the adsorption and
desorption rates must be equal.
We can then apply the Langmuir theory for each layer
as presented in Table~\ref{pyg:tab:bet-deriv}. We can
assume that the adsorption energy of a molecule on the second
and higher layers is just the condensation energy of the
adsorbent \(E_{i>1} = E_L\). Since we are assuming that
all layers beside the first have the same properties,
we can also define \(g= {k_{d_2}}{k_{a_2}} = {k_{d_3}}{k_{a_3}} =
\cdots\).

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Derivation of the BET method applied for,
		each adsorbed layer}%
	\label{pyg:tab:bet-deriv}
	\begin{tabular}{cc}

				\exp{\Big(-\frac{E_L}{RT}\Big)}
			\end{align*}}              \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The coverage for each layer \(\theta\) can now be
expressed in terms of \(\theta_0\).

\begin{align}
	\theta_i & = \Big[p \frac{k_{a_1}}{k_{d_1}} \exp{\Big(-\frac{E_1}{RT}\Big)}\Big] x^{i-1} \theta_0
	\intertext{where}
	x        & = \frac{p}{g} \exp{\Big(-\frac{E_L}{RT}\Big)}
\end{align}

A constant C may be defined such that:

\begin{align}
	C        & = \frac{k_{a_1}}{k_{d_1}} g \exp{\Big(\frac{E_1 - E_L}{RT}\Big)} \\
	\theta_i & = C x^i \theta_0
\end{align}

For all the layers, the equations can be summed:

\begin{align}
	\frac{n}{n_m} & = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i \theta^i = C
	\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i x^i \theta_0
	%
	\intertext{and since}
	%
	\theta_0      & = 1 - \sum_{1}^{\infty} \theta_i
	\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i x^i = \frac{x}{(1-x)^2}
\end{align}

Then we obtain the BET equation:

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:bet}
	n_a(p) = n_a^m \frac{C (p/p_0)}{(1-p/p_0)[1-(p/p_0)+ C (p/p_0)]}
\end{equation}

The BET constant \(C\) is a measure of the interaction with the 
adsorption surface and can be seen to influence the ``knee''
a BET-type isotherm has at low pressure, before the statistical
monolayer formation.

\subsubsection{Toth model}\label{pyg:models:toth}

The Toth model is an empirical modification to the Langmuir equation
(\ref{pyg:eqn:langmuir})
which introduces a power parameter for the denominator leading to
the following formula:

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:toth}
	n_a(p) = n_a^m \frac{K p}{{[1 + {(K p)}^t]}^{1/t}}
\end{equation}

The parameter \(t\) is a measure of the system heterogeneity.
Thanks to this additional parameter, the Toth equation can
accurately describe a large number of adsorbent/adsorbate systems
and, due to its correct behaviour in both the low and high pressure
limits, is recommended as the fitting isotherms of many
adsorbents such as hydrocarbons, carbon oxides, hydrogen sulphide
and alcohols on activated carbons and zeolites.

\subsubsection{Temkin model}\label{pyg:models:temkin}

The Temkin adsorption
isotherm~\cite{temkinKineticsAmmoniaSynthesis1940},
like the Langmuir model, considers
a surface with \(n_a^m\) identical adsorption sites, but takes into
account adsorbate-
adsorbate interactions by assuming that the heat of adsorption is a
linear
function of the coverage. This expression for the Temkin isotherm is
derived
using a mean-field argument and uses an asymptotic approximation
to obtain an explicit equation for the
loading~\cite{simonOptimizingNanoporousMaterials2014}.

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:temkin}
	n_a(p) = n_a^m \frac{Kp}{1+Kp} + n_a^m \theta
	{\Big(\frac{Kp}{1+Kp}\Big)}^2 \Big(\frac{Kp}{1+Kp} -1\Big)
\end{equation}

Here, \(n_a^m\) and K have the same physical meaning as in the
Langmuir model.
The additional parameter \(\theta\) describes the strength of the
adsorbate-adsorbate
interactions (\(\theta < 0\) for attractions).

\subsubsection{Jensen-Seaton model}\label{pyg:models:jseaton}

When modelling adsorption in micropores, a requirement was
highlighted by
Jensen and Seaton in 1996~\cite{jensenIsothermEquationAdsorption1996}
that at sufficiently high pressures the adsorption
isotherm should not reach a horizontal plateau corresponding to
saturation but
that this asymptote should continue to rise due to the compression
of the adsorbate in the pores. They developed a semi-empirical
equation
to describe this phenomenon based on a function that interpolates
between
two asymptotes: the Henry’s law asymptote at low pressure and an
asymptote reflecting the compressibility of the adsorbate at
high pressure.

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:jseaton}
	n(p) = K_H p \Big{(1 + \frac{K_H p}{{[a {(1 + b
									p)}]}^c}\Big)}^{(-1/c)}
\end{equation}

Here \(K_H\) is the Henry constant, \(b\) is the compressibility of
the
adsorbed phase and \(c\) an empirical constant.

The equation can be used to model both absolute and excess adsorption
as the pore
volume can be incorporated into the definition of \(b\), although
this can lead
to negative adsorption slopes for the compressibility asymptote.
This equation has been found to provide a better fit for experimental
data
from microporous solids than the Langmuir or Toth equation, in
particular for
adsorbent/adsorbate systems with high Henry’s constants where the
amount adsorbed
increases rapidly at relatively low pressures and then slows down
dramatically.

\subsubsection{Quadratic model}\label{pyg:models:quadratic}

The quadratic adsorption
isotherm~\cite{hillIntroductionStatisticalThermodynamics1986}
exhibits an inflection point. The loading is convex at low
pressures but changes concavity as it saturates, yielding
an S-shape. The S-shape can be explained by adsorbate-adsorbate
attractive
forces; the initial convexity is due to a cooperative
effect of adsorbate-adsorbate attractions aiding in the recruitment
of
additional adsorbate molecules.

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:quad}
	n(p) = n_a^m \frac{(K_a + 2 K_b p)p}{1+K_{ap} + K_{bp}^2}
\end{equation}

The parameter \(K_a\) can be interpreted as the Langmuir constant;
the
strength of the adsorbate-adsorbate attractive forces is embedded in
\(K_b\).

\subsubsection{Virial model}\label{pyg:models:virial}

A virial isotherm model attempts to fit the measured data to a
factorized
exponent relationship between loading and
pressure~\cite{myersThermodynamicsAdsorptionPorous2002}.

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:virial}
	p = n \exp{(K_1n^0 + K_2n^1 + K_3n^2 + K_4n^3 + \cdots + K_i
		n^{i-1})}
\end{equation}

It has been applied with success to describe the behaviour of
standard as
well as supercritical isotherms. The factors are usually empirical,
although some relationship with physical properties can be
determined:
the first constant is related to the Henry constant at zero loading,
while
the second constant is a measure of the interaction strength with the
surface.

\begin{equation}
	K_1 = -\ln{K_{H,0}}
\end{equation}

In practice, besides the first constant, only 2-3 factors are used.

\subsubsection{Vacancy solution theory models}\label{pyg:models:vst}

As a part of the Vacancy Solution Theory (VST) family of models, it
is based on concept
of a “vacancy” species, denoted v, and assumes that the system
consists of a
mixture of these vacancies and the adsorbate.

The VST model is defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}

	\item A vacancy is an imaginary entity defined as a vacuum
	      space
	      which acts as the solvent in both the gas and adsorbed
	      phases.
	\item The properties of the adsorbed phase are defined as
	      excess properties
	      in relation to a dividing surface.
	\item The entire system including the adsorbent are in
	      thermal equilibrium
	      however only the gas and adsorbed phases are in
	      thermodynamic equilibrium.
	\item The equilibrium of the system is maintained by the
	      spreading pressure
	      which arises from a potential field at the surface

\end{itemize}

It is possible to derive expressions for the vacancy chemical
potential in both
the adsorbed phase and the gas phase, which when equated give the
following equation
of state for the adsorbed phase:

\begin{equation}
	\pi = - \frac{R_g T}{\sigma_v} \ln{y_v x_v}
\end{equation}

where \(y_v\) is the activity coefficient and  \(x_v\) is the mole
fraction of
the vacancy in the adsorbed phase.
This can then be introduced into the Gibbs equation to give a general
isotherm equation
for the Vacancy Solution Theory where \(K_H\) is the Henry’s constant
and
\(f(\theta)\) is a function that describes the non-ideality of the
system based
on activity coefficients:

\begin{equation}
	p = \frac{n_{ads}}{K_H} \frac{\theta}{1-\theta} f(\theta)
\end{equation}

The general VST equation requires an expression for the activity
coefficients.
The Wilson~\cite{suwanayuenGasAdsorptionIsotherm1980} equation can be
used,
which expresses the activity coefficient in terms
of the mole fractions of the two species (adsorbate and vacancy) and
two constants
\(\Lambda_{1v}\) and \(\Lambda_{1v}\). The equation becomes:

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:wvst}
	p = \bigg( \frac{n_{ads}}{K_H} \frac{\theta}{1-\theta} \bigg)
	\bigg( \Lambda_{1v}
	\frac{1-(1-\Lambda_{v1})\theta}{\Lambda_{1v}+(1-\Lambda_{1v})\theta}
	\bigg)
	\exp{\bigg(
		-\frac{\Lambda_{v1}(1-\Lambda_{v1})\theta}{1-(1-\Lambda_{v1})\theta}
		-\frac{(1 - \Lambda_{1v})\theta}{\Lambda_{1v} +
			(1-\Lambda_{1v}\theta)} \bigg)}
\end{equation}

Cochran~\cite{cochranVacancySolutionTheory1985}
developed a simpler, three parameter equation based on
the Flory–Huggins equation for the activity coefficient.
The equation for then becomes:

\begin{equation}\label{pyg:eqn:fhvst}
	p = \bigg( \frac{n_{ads}}{K_H} \frac{\theta}{1-\theta} \bigg)
	\exp{\frac{\alpha^2_{1v}\theta}{1+\alpha_{1v}\theta}}
	\quad \text{where} \quad
	\alpha_{1v} = \frac{\alpha_{1}}{\alpha_{v}} - 1
\end{equation}

Here \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{v}\) are the molar areas of the
adsorbate
and the vacancy respectively.
