  abstract = {Scientific progress is severely impeded if experimental measurements are not reproducible. Materials chemistry and related fields commonly report new materials with limited attention paid to reproducibility. Here, we describe methods that are well suited to assessing reproducibility in these fields via retrospective analysis of reported data. This concept is illustrated by an exhaustive analysis of a topic that has been the focus of thousands of published studies, gas adsorption in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. We show that for the well-studied case of CO2 adsorption there are only 15 of the thousands of known MOFs for which enough experiments have been reported to allow strong conclusions to be drawn about the reproducibility of these measurements. Our results have immediate implications for the characterization of gas adsorption in porous materials but, more importantly, demonstrate an approach to assessing reproducibility that will be widely applicable in materials chemistry.},

  abstract = {A non-interpenetrated metal\textendash{}organic framework with a paddle-wheel secondary building unit has been activated by direct thermal evacuation, guest exchange with a volatile solvent, and supercritical CO2 drying. Conventional thermal activation yields a mixture of crystalline phases and some amorphous content. Exchange with a volatile solvent prior to vacuum activation produces a pure breathing phase with high sorption capacity, selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4, and substantial hysteresis. Supercritical drying can be used to access a guest-free open phase. Pressure-resolved differential scanning calorimetry was used to confirm and investigate a systematic loss of sorption capacity by the breathing phase as a function of successive cycles of sorption and desorption. A corresponding loss of sample integrity was not detectable by powder X-ray diffraction analysis. This may be an important factor to consider in cases where flexible MOFs are earmarked for industrial applications.},
