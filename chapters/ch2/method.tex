\section{Methods}

\subsection{Microcalorimetry}

In this thesis, combined isotherms and enthalpy of adsorption
measurements were made experimentally using a Tian-Calvet type
microcalorimeter coupled with a home-made manometric gas dosing
system~\cite{llewellynGasAdsorptionMicrocalorimetry2005}. 
This apparatus allows the simultaneous measurement 
of the adsorption isotherm and the corresponding differential 
enthalpies. Gas is introduced into the system using a step-by-step
method and each dose is allowed to stabilize in a
reference volume before being brought into contact with the
adsorbent located in the microcalorimeter. The introduction of the
adsorbate to the sample is accompanied by an exothermic thermal signal,
measured by the thermopiles of the microcalorimeter. The peak in the
calorimetric signal is integrated over time 
to give the total energy released during this adsorption step.
At low coverage the error in the signal can be estimated to around 
\( \pm \) \SI{0.2} {\kilo\joule\per\mol}. Around \SI{0.4}{\gram} of 
sample is used in each experiment. 
For each injection of gas, equilibrium was assumed to have
been reached after 90 minutes. This was confirmed by the return
of the calorimetric signal to its baseline (<\SI{5}{\micro\watt}).
