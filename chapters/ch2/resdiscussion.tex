\section{Measurements and analysis}

\subsection{Comparison between enthalpies of adsorption measured
	through the direct and indirect method}

In order to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the isosteric 
and calorimetric method of measuring the enthalpy of adsorption, 
a sample of UiO-66(Zr) previously used for a study of 
carbon dioxide~\cite{wiersumEvaluationUiO66GasBased2011} adsorption
was also measured using microcalorimetry.
Two previous isotherms were recorded through gravimetry at \SI{303}{\kelvin} and
\SI{323}{\kelvin} respectively and the new isotherm was measured in the 
calorimeter at \SI{303}{\kelvin}. The complete set of isotherms can
be found in \autoref{calo:fgr:uioisostericiso}.
The two isotherms measured at \SI{303}{\kelvin} are nearly identical, 
ensuring that the both adsorption apparatus are working as intended.
The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption is calculated from the two isotherms
at different temperature, either using an interpolation method,or through
initial fitting of a virial model (\autoref{pyg:model:virial}).
The values are then adjusted according to \autoref{calo:eqn:adj}.
Calculated and measured values for the enthalpy of adsorption are overlaid
in \autoref{calo:fgr:uioisostericheat} as a function of amount adsorbed.\todo{is this ok?}

\end{figure}

When comparing the differential enthalpy of adsorption measured through
calorimetry to the isosteric enthalpy obtained through interpolation, 
a good overlap can be seen for the most part, but the two values
diverge at low loadings and near complete coverage. 
At low loading the small errors in pressure measurement introduce
large errors in the isosteric enthalpy. By using the model-fitted 
isotherms instead, a better agreement can be achieved. However, the 
virial model still cannot account for the presence of active sites in the 
MOF, as seen in the discrepancy of the first adsorption point.
The calorimetric measurement is therefore more suited to the low pressure
range. At higher loadings, where the isotherm reaches a plateau and
the change in adsorbed amount is small between each adsorbate
insertion, errors are introduced in the calorimetric calculation of
the enthalpy of adsorption, as can be seen from the extent of the error
bars in \autoref{calo:fgr:uioisostericheat}.
Here, the indirect calculation provides the more accurate results.
As such, the two techniques can be thought of as complementary.

\subsection{An example dataset on a reference material}

A sample of microporous carbon, Takeda 5A (\autoref{appx:synthesis:takeda})
was used as a reference material to exemplify the type of information
that can be obtained through the combined manometric and 
calorimetric method. Pure gas adsorption data has been recorded at 
\SI{303}{\kelvin} using \ce{N2}, \ce{CO}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H6},
\ce{C3H6} and \ce{C3H8} as probes. The complete dataset can be seen 
in \autoref{fgr:takedadataset}, with the correspoding differential 
enthalpy curves presented in

Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are similar in their adsorption behaviour,
with a nearly linear isotherm and low capacities.
Hydrocarbons are adsorbed with higher loadings, with both propane and propylene
reaching a plateau at low pressures. Propylene is seen to have a
higher capacity than propane, with packing effects as a likely cause.
Carbon dioxide has the highest loading capacity of the entire dataset.

Two parameters can be useful in characterising the local pore environment
before guest-guest interactions come into effect: the Henry constant at
low loadings as well as the initial enthalpy of adsorption. Both can
be calculated with \texttt{pyGAPS}, with several options in
regard to the methodology. Here, Henry's constant is calculated using the
\lstinline{pygaps.initial_henry_virial()} function, which fits a virial model to
the isotherm and then takes the limit at loading approaching zero. The initial enthalpy of
adsorption is obtained through the \lstinline{pygaps.initial_enthalpy_comp()} function.
This fits the enthalpy curve to a compound contribution from
guest-host interaction, defects, guest-guest attraction and repulsion using a minimization
algorithm. The results of the calculations are plotted versus the polarizability of the
gas used, which can be obtained from the respective \texttt{Adsorbate} class.
Figure~\ref{fgr:takedatrends} shows that both the parameters fall on a linear
trend, which suggests that the interactions between those guests and the pore walls are
mostly due to Lennard-Jones interactions. Carbon dioxide has a higher enthalpy
of adsorption than the baseline due to the contribution from its quadrupole moment.
There is almost a complete overlap between propane and propylene, which leads to
the conclusion that the unsaturated double bond does not interact in a specific way
with the carbon surface.
The difference between the two isotherms is due exclusively to steric and packing effects.
