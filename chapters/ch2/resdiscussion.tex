\section{Measurements and analysis}

\subsection{Comparison between the enthalpy of adsorption measured
	through the direct and indirect method}

In order to view the difference that may arise between the isosteric 
and calorimetric method of measuring the enthalpy of adsorption, 
a sample of UiO-66(Zr) previously used for a study of 
carbon dioxide~\cite{wiersumEvaluationUiO66GasBased2011} adsorption
was also measured through microcalorimetry.
Two previous isotherms were recorded at \SI{303}{\kelvin} and
\SI{323}{\kelvin} respectively, with the new isotherm measured in the 
calorimeter at \SI{303}{\kelvin}. The complete set of isotherms is
loaded into \texttt{pyGAPS} and plotted by the \lstinline{pygaps.plot_iso()}
function as seen in \autoref{calo:fgr:uioisostericiso}.
To calculate the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption, the two isotherms
measured for this purpose are first fitted with a virial type model,
then passed through the \lstinline{pygaps.isosteric_heat()} function.
Results from the calculation are overlaid on top of the measured
calorimetric data in \autoref{calo:fgr:uioisostericheat} as a function
of amount adsorbed.

The two datasets overlap for the most part but
diverge at low loadings and near complete
coverage. At low loading the small errors in pressure measurement introduce
large errors in the isosteric enthalpy. This, together with the breakdown
of the assumption of equilibrium due to active sites in the MOF mean that
the calorimetric measurement is more suited to this range. At higher
loadings, where the isotherm reaches a plateau and the change in adsorbed
amount is small between each adsorbate insertion, errors are
introduced in the direct calculation of the enthalpy of adsorption.
Here, the indirect calculation provides the more accurate results.
As such, the two techniques are complementary.

\subsection{Analysis of a carbon sample for gas separation applications}

A sample of reference carbon Takeda 5A (\autoref{appx:synthesis:takeda})
is to be investigated for an in-depth characterisation of
the adsorption behaviour of pure gases, with a focus on describing the pore environment.
Afterwards, the performance of different binary separations is evaluated,
such as \ce{CO2}/\ce{N2} and propane/propylene.

Pure gas adsorption data has been recorded at \SI{303}{\kelvin} in
conjunction with
microcalorimetry on \ce{N2}, \ce{CO}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H6},
\ce{C3H6} and \ce{C3H8}. The complete dataset is plotted with the
\lstinline{pygaps.plot_iso()} function and can be seen in Figure~\ref{fgr:takedadataset}.

Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are similar in their adsorption behaviour,
with a nearly linear isotherm and low capacities.
Hydrocarbons are adsorbed with higher loadings, with both propane and propylene
reaching a plateau at low pressures. Propylene is seen to have a
higher capacity than propane, with packing effects as a likely cause.
Carbon dioxide has the highest loading capacity of the entire dataset.

Two parameters can be useful in characterising the local pore environment
before guest-guest interactions come into effect: the Henry constant at
low loadings as well as the initial enthalpy of adsorption. Both can
be calculated with \texttt{pyGAPS}, with several options in
regard to the methodology. Here, Henry's constant is calculated using the
\lstinline{pygaps.initial_henry_virial()} function, which fits a virial model to
the isotherm and then takes the limit at loading approaching zero. The initial enthalpy of
adsorption is obtained through the \lstinline{pygaps.initial_enthalpy_comp()} function.
This fits the enthalpy curve to a compound contribution from
guest-host interaction, defects, guest-guest attraction and repulsion using a minimization
algorithm. The results of the calculations are plotted versus the polarizability of the
gas used, which can be obtained from the respective \texttt{Adsorbate} class.
Figure~\ref{fgr:takedatrends} shows that both the parameters fall on a linear
trend, which suggests that the interactions between those guests and the pore walls are
mostly due to Lennard-Jones interactions. Carbon dioxide has a higher enthalpy
of adsorption than the baseline due to the contribution from its quadrupole moment.
There is almost a complete overlap between propane and propylene, which leads to
the conclusion that the unsaturated double bond does not interact in a specific way
with the carbon surface.
The difference between the two isotherms is due exclusively to steric and packing effects.
