\section{Case studies for the use of 
microcalorimetry combined with adsorption experiments}

\subsection{Comparison between enthalpies of adsorption measured
	through the direct and indirect method}

In order to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the isosteric 
and calorimetric method of measuring the enthalpy of adsorption, 
a sample of UiO-66(Zr) previously used for a study of 
carbon dioxide~\cite{wiersumEvaluationUiO66GasBased2011} adsorption
was also measured using microcalorimetry.
Two isotherms were recorded through gravimetry at \SI{303}{\kelvin} and
\SI{323}{\kelvin} respectively and a separate isotherm was measured in the 
calorimeter at \SI{303}{\kelvin}. The complete set of isotherms can
be found in \autoref{calo:fig:uioisostericiso}.
The two isotherms measured at \SI{303}{\kelvin} are nearly identical, 
ensuring that the both adsorption apparatus are working as intended.
The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption is calculated from the two isotherms
at different temperatures, either using an interpolation method, or through
initial fitting of a virial model (\autoref{pyg:models:virial}).
The values are then adjusted according to \autoref{calo:eqn:adj}.
Calculated and measured values for the enthalpy of adsorption are overlaid
in \autoref{calo:fig:uioisostericheat} as a function of amount adsorbed.

\end{figure}

When comparing the differential enthalpy of adsorption measured through
calorimetry to the isosteric enthalpy obtained through interpolation, 
a good overlap can be seen for the most part, but the two values
diverge at low loadings and near complete coverage. 
At low loading the small errors in pressure measurement introduce
large errors in the isosteric enthalpy. By using the model-fitted 
isotherms instead, a better agreement can be achieved. However, the 
virial model still cannot account for the presence of active sites in the 
\gls{MOF}, as seen in the discrepancy of the first adsorption point.
The calorimetric measurement is therefore more suited to the low pressure
range. At higher loadings, where the isotherm reaches a plateau and
the change in adsorbed amount is small between each adsorbate
insertion, errors are introduced in the enthalpy of adsorption 
calculation from the small adsorbed amounts, as can be seen from the
extent of the error bars in \autoref{calo:fig:uioisostericheat}.
Here, the indirect calculation provides the more accurate results.
As such, the two techniques can be thought of as complementary.

\subsection{An example dataset on a reference material}

A sample of microporous carbon, Takeda 5A (with details of the sample 
found in \autoref{appx:synthesis:takeda})
was used as a reference material to exemplify the type of information
that can be obtained through the combined manometric and 
calorimetric method. Pure gas adsorption data has been recorded at 
\SI{303}{\kelvin} using \ce{N2}, \ce{CO}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H6},
\ce{C3H6} and \ce{C3H8} as probes. The complete dataset can be seen 
in \autoref{calo:fig:takeda-dataset}, with the corresponding differential 
enthalpy curves presented in \autoref{calo:fig:takeda-enthalpy}.

It should first be highlighted that the isotherms can be split into 
two adsorption regimes: subcritical, as is the case for carbon
dioxide and all hydrocarbons except methane, and supercritical,
as is the case for nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane.
Supercritical gases do not have any distinction between the 
gaseous and liquid phase, therefore the density of the adsorbed phase
cannot be likened to that of a corresponding liquid. The enthalpy
of vaporisation of such a fluid in this regime is necessarily zero.
However, in-depth studies of supercritical 
isotherms~\cite{doAdsorptionSupercriticalFluids2003} have shown that
the density of the adsorbed phase is highly dependent on the surface 
area of the material. As the interactions in this regime are essentially
restricted to guest-host interactions, the density can can approach that
of a liquid in highly microporous and strong pore field gradient materials.

Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are similar in their adsorption behaviour,
with a nearly linear isotherm, and low capacities.
The enthalpy curves are also an indication of non-specific 
interactions with the surface, as the enthalpy of adsorption
is nearly constant throughout the entire loading range.
Carbon dioxide has the highest loading capacity of the entire dataset, 
likely due to a combination of a small molecular size and strong 
interactions with the carbon pore walls leading to a pronounced 
compressibility inside the pores. The enthalpy curve shows a higher energy
of adsorption at low loading by \SIrange{5}{10}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}, 
corresponding to adsorption on a slightly heterogeneous surface.
The adsorption of hydrocarbons can be related to their size, with
both the initial slope and the enthalpy of adsorption increasing linearly
as a function of the carbon number. Each methyl group is seen 
to contribute, on average, with around 
\SIrange{10}{15}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}
to the mean enthalpy of adsorption~\cite{denayerChromatographicStudyAdsorption1998}.
When it comes to saturated versus unsaturated hydrocarbons, propylene is 
seen to have a higher capacity than propane. As the enthalpy of 
adsorption is identical at low loading, specific interactions with the 
\(\pi\) electrons of the double bond are unlikely, with packing effects 
from the smaller kinetic diameter of propylene as a more plausible
explanation.

Two parameters can be useful in characterising the local pore environment
before guest-guest interactions come into effect: the Henry constant at
low loadings \gls{kH0} as well as the initial differential enthalpy of
adsorption. Here, the initial Henry's constant is calculated by fitting
a virial model to the isotherm, then taking the limit of the function at
zero loading. 

The initial enthalpy of adsorption can be determined from calorimetric 
methods simply by using the value of the first measured point.
However, this procedure is susceptible to large errors, particularly
if the isotherm has no points in the low coverage region. An alternative
is to take an average of all recorded points, a method which assumes
a homogenous surface. \citet{myersThermodynamicsAdsorptionPorous2002},
has suggested that the enthalpy curve follows a polynomial model, similar
to a virial isotherm.
In this work, an empirical method is used where the enthalpy curve
is treated as a compound contribution from guest-host interaction,
guest-guest attraction and repulsion, the factors of which are determined
using a minimization algorithm. Adsorbate-adsorbate interaction is 
represented as a logistic function, which can account for both 
a heterogeneous surface and a micropore filling step. Power functions
are used for both attraction and repulsion factors. An example of 
an enthalpy curve fitted with this method can be seen 
in \autoref{calo:fig:takeda-enth-fit}

		trends for initial enthalpy of adsorption and Henry's constant}%
	\label{calo:fig:takeda-analysis}

\end{figure}

A useful method of displaying the two parameters can be to plot them
as a function of the polarizability of the probe, as in
\autoref{calo:fig:takeda-trends}. Both parameters follow a linear
trend, which suggests that the interactions between the guests and the
pore walls are mostly due to non-specific interactions with the field
gradient of the pore. Carbon dioxide has a higher enthalpy
of adsorption than the baseline, which can be ascribed to the contribution 
from its quadrupole moment. There is almost a complete overlap between 
propane and propylene, confirming that the unsaturated double bond does not
interact in a specific way with the carbon surface.
