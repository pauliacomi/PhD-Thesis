While the previous chapter focused on the processing of adsorption
isotherms, the thermodynamic background 


Adsorption can be likened to a phase change. The increased density

First, an overview of the theoretical aspects underpinning 
the energetics of adsorption is presented. The methods 
section will go into detail in the available methodology
for studying the heat of adsorption on surfaces and in 
pores. The final part of the chapter will explore the use
of heat of adsorption measured in conjunction with isotherms
as a useful way of extending characterisation of porous
materials.
