  abstract = {A novel Zr-fumarate (Zr-fum) metal organic framework was synthesized by the reaction of zirconium chloride and fumaric acid under solvothermal conditions without a formic acid modulator. The synthesized material was characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques. The results of powder XRD showed the presence of amorphous and crystalline phases. The surface area and average pore diameter of the material were found to be 205.49 m2/g and 2.12 nm, respectively, and TGA showed that the material was stable up to 300$^\circ$C. The CO2 adsorption properties of the Zr-fum MOF revealed an uptake of 8 wt\% at room temperature (25$^\circ$C) and atmospheric pressure. The cyclic CO2 sorption study showed the complete recyclability of the synthesized material, suggesting that the material has potential for use in gas sorption and separation.},

  abstract = {Fluoride excess in water is harmful to human beings. Adsorption is an effective way to remove fluoride in water. Exploring novel and efficient sorbents for fluoride adsorption is very necessary and challenging. In this work, the fluoride adsorption behavior of zirconium fumarate metal-organic framework-801 (MOF-801) in water is studied through batch adsorption experiments. MOF-801 has high and stable adsorption efficiency at pH 2\textendash{}10. The fluoride adsorption capacity on MOF-801 is neither affected by high ion strength nor other anions including Cl-, NO3- and SO42-. The fluoride adsorption on MOF-801 follows a pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir equation. The fluoride adsorption capacity of MOF-801 is 40 mg g-1 at 303 K, changing little with temperature. The effective defluoridation of MOF-801 resulted from the ion exchange of fluoride ions and hydroxyl group in MOF-801. The practical use of MOF-801 for fluoride adsorption from real water sample reveals the potential of MOF-801 as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of fluoride from water.},

  abstract = {The nanoporous and tunable nature of metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) has made them promising adsorbents for water adsorption applications such as water harvesting and adsorptive heat pumps. In these applications, water adsorption properties in MOFs play a crucial role. However, understanding their structural defects and how defects influence adsorption thermodynamics remains limited to date. In this work, by employing Monte Carlo techniques and first-principle density functional theory calculations, we investigate the effect of defects on the water adsorption properties in MOF-801 structures at an atomic level. Our calculations show that the adsorption isotherm in perfect MOF-801 (without defects) greatly deviates from that measured experimentally. With the introduction of defects with a high density, a reasonably good agreement can be achieved, suggesting that a high defect density in MOF-801 may be responsible for its hydrophilic adsorptive behaviors. Further, water adsorption properties in MOF-801 structures are found to depend on the spatial configuration of defects, and water condensation in nanoporous MOF-801 is identified to occur preferentially along the \langle{}110\rangle{} direction. Detailed structural characteristics (accessible volume, etc.) of MOF-801 structures and the adsorption energetics of water in the frameworks are also studied and correlated with the computed adsorption isotherms. Our findings reveal important insights into the role of defects, offering a microscopic picture to help facilitate the rational design of better MOFs for water adsorption applications.},

The original synthesis of Zr-fum MOF was performed in a DMF-based batch at 120 $^\circ$C. The product showed exceptional stability against aqueous solutions. Thus, a water-based synthesis seemed to be promising. Indeed, by adding various amounts of formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid as modulator, respectively, highly crystalline Zr-fum MOF can be obtained from water at 120 $^\circ$C. The investigation of the influence of modulating molecules with different alkyl chain lengths showed that the particle size decreases when monocarboxylic acids with longer alkyl chains are used, e.g. acetic acid and propionic acid in comparison to formic acid. For the formation of the Zr-fum MOF synthesised with formic acid as modulator, the thermogravimetric and sorption behaviour as well as the stability against various solvents and pH values is discussed in detail. Furthermore, the Zr-fum MOF can also be obtained under very benign reaction conditions at room temperature from water, making this material interesting for various applications, for example as a biomaterial.},

  abstract = {We present the synthesis and characterization of a novel Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF) which contains fumarate (fum) dianions as linkers: -OOC-CHCH-COO -. The synthesis of this MOF is possible only via modulation, i.e. by the addition of a monocarboxylic acid to the synthesis mixture. We have used formic acid as a modulator and have investigated its influence on the synthesis of the Zr-fumarate MOF in detail. The modulator improves the crystallinity of the material; varying its amounts, the crystal size and the degree of aggregation can be influenced. The novel MOF probably has a topology which is similar to that of UiO-66, but has a primitive cubic lattice instead of a face-centered one. A structural model in line with the experimental data is proposed. The Zr-fum MOF is further characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Ar sorption, showing that it can be activated and exhibits microporosity. The linker fumarate as well as the modulator formic acid used in the synthesis of Zr-fum MOF are both naturally occurring molecules; possible applications of the MOF may thus lie in the field of biomaterials. Therefore, the stability of Zr-fum MOF was tested in water-based salt solutions commonly used in biomedical research. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A combined experimental and theoretical investigation of propane and propylene adsorption in the metal?organic framework CuBTC is presented. The dependence of adsorption enthalpies on the adsorbed amount was determined by microcalorimetry up to 8 mmol g?1 coverage (roughly C3Hn/Cu2+ ratio of 1.5). Trends observed experimentally were interpreted on the basis of accurate calculations carried out at the hybrid DFT?ab initio level. Three types of adsorption sites were identified; however, qualitatively different results were obtained for propane and propylene. Propane preferentially adsorbs at the cage center sites (??H$^\circ$ = 43 kJ mol?1), followed by adsorption at the cage window sites (31 kJ mol?1), while the interaction with the coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) is relatively weak (24 kJ mol?1). On the contrary, propylene preferentially interacts with the CUS (56 kJ mol?1), while the adsorption at the cage center and cage window sites was found to be only 45 and 34 kJ mol?1, respectively. Due to the topology of CuBTC, lateral interactions are significantly more important among the adsorbates located at the cage center and cage window sites (populated in the case of propane) than among adsorbates at the CUS and cage center sites (populated in the case of propylene). Therefore, adsorption energies obtained for coverages above 6 mmol g?1 of adsorbed amount were larger for propane than for propylene. Consequently, the presence of small cages makes the CuBTC MOF less suitable for propane/propylene separation than MOFs having the Cu2+ CUS but without small cages (e.g., CPO-27).},

Several examples are thus given with zeolites and related materials which can be considered as model adsorbents showing the information that can be obtained at low temperature (77 K) and at room temperature.

  abstract = {Water adsorption in porous materials is important for many applications such as dehumidification, thermal batteries, and delivery of drinking water in remote areas. In this study, we have identified three criteria for achieving high performing porous materials for water adsorption. These criteria deal with condensation pressure of water in the pores, uptake capacity, and recyclability and water stability of the material. In search of an excellently performing porous material, we have studied and compared the water adsorption properties of 23 materials, 20 of which are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Among the MOFs are 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), -802, -805, -806, -808, -812, and -841 reported for the first time. MOF-801-P (microcrystalline powder form) was reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption properties. MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examined for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis. All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr6O4(OH)4(-CO2)n secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl organic linkers to make extended porous frameworks. The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temperature. An X-ray single-crystal study and a powder neutron diffraction study reveal the position of the water adsorption sites in MOF-801 and highlight the importance of the intermolecular interaction between adsorbed water molecules within the pores.},

This concept is illustrated by an exhaustive analysis of a topic that has been the focus of thousands of published studies, gas adsorption in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. We show that for the well-studied case of CO2 adsorption there are only 15 of the thousands of known MOFs for which enough experiments have been reported to allow strong conclusions to be drawn about the reproducibility of these measurements. Our results have immediate implications for the characterization of gas adsorption in porous materials but, more importantly, demonstrate an approach to assessing reproducibility that will be widely applicable in materials chemistry.},

Isotherms and differential enthalpies of adsorption in the low pressure domain as well as the Henry\~Os constants are reported for each investigated system. The effect of the extra-framework cations on adsorbate/adsorbent interactions are discussed on the basis of the values of differential enthalpies of adsorption at zero coverage. This quantity increases in the sequences LiX $>$ NaX $>$ KX and CaX $>$ SrX $>$ BaX for both argon and nitrogen. These experimental trends can be interpreted from predominant polarisation effects induced by the cations for argon adsorption whereas a combination of both electrostatic and polarisation contributions is required for nitrogen adsorption.},
