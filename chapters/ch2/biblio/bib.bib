  abstract = {The present work shows how gas adsorption microcalorimetry is a particularly powerful experimental technique as it allows both an in depth examination of the surface state of adsorbents and a minute following of adsorption mechanisms such as phase changes and transitions. Several examples are thus given with zeolites and related materials which can be considered as model adsorbents showing the information that can be obtained at low temperature (77 K) and at room temperature. In the later sections, the increasing importance of modelling is highlighted as a tool to complete experiments and to gain a greater understanding of the microscopic mechanisms in play during adsorption phenomena. To cite this article: P. L. Llewellyn et al., C. R. Chimie 8 (2005). Nous montrons dans ce travail que la microcalorim\'etrie d'adsorption en phase gazeuse est une technique exp\'erimentale particuli\`erement pr\'ecieuse, parce qu'elle permet, d'une part, de conna\^itre l'\'etat de surface des adsorbants avec une r\'esolution tr\`es fine et, d'autre part, de suivre minutieusement les m\'ecanismes d'adsorption mis en jeu ainsi que les \'eventuelles transitions de phases des adsorbants. Plusieurs exemples sont ainsi fournis sur l'\'etude de mat\'eriaux mod\`eles : les z\'eolithes et les mat\'eriaux apparent\'es, en soulignant quelles sont les informations qui peuvent \^etre extraites, soit \`a basse temp\'erature (77 K), soit \`a temp\'erature ambiante. Dans la derni\`ere partie, nous soulignons l'importance accrue de la mod\'elisation afin de compl\'eter l'outil exp\'erimental et de mieux cerner les m\'ecanismes microscopiques mis en jeu dans les ph\'enom\`enes d'adsorption.

  doi = {10.1021/jp401600v},
  abstract = {A combined experimental and theoretical investigation of propane and propylene adsorption in the metal?organic framework CuBTC is presented. The dependence of adsorption enthalpies on the adsorbed amount was determined by microcalorimetry up to 8 mmol g?1 coverage (roughly C3Hn/Cu2+ ratio of 1.5). Trends observed experimentally were interpreted on the basis of accurate calculations carried out at the hybrid DFT?ab initio level. Three types of adsorption sites were identified; however, qualitatively different results were obtained for propane and propylene. Propane preferentially adsorbs at the cage center sites (??H$^\circ$ = 43 kJ mol?1), followed by adsorption at the cage window sites (31 kJ mol?1), while the interaction with the coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) is relatively weak (24 kJ mol?1). On the contrary, propylene preferentially interacts with the CUS (56 kJ mol?1), while the adsorption at the cage center and cage window sites was found to be only 45 and 34 kJ mol?1, respectively. Due to the topology of CuBTC, lateral interactions are significantly more important among the adsorbates located at the cage center and cage window sites (populated in the case of propane) than among adsorbates at the CUS and cage center sites (populated in the case of propylene). Therefore, adsorption energies obtained for coverages above 6 mmol g?1 of adsorbed amount were larger for propane than for propylene. Consequently, the presence of small cages makes the CuBTC MOF less suitable for propane/propylene separation than MOFs having the Cu2+ CUS but without small cages (e.g., CPO-27).},

Materials chemistry and related fields commonly report new materials with limited attention paid to reproducibility. Here, we describe methods that are well suited to assessing reproducibility in these fields via retrospective analysis of reported data. This concept is illustrated by an exhaustive analysis of a topic that has been the focus of thousands of published studies, gas adsorption in metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. We show that for the well-studied case of CO2 adsorption there are only 15 of the thousands of known MOFs for which enough experiments have been reported to allow strong conclusions to be drawn about the reproducibility of these measurements. Our results have immediate implications for the characterization of gas adsorption in porous materials but, more importantly, demonstrate an approach to assessing reproducibility that will be widely applicable in materials chemistry.},

Isotherms and differential enthalpies of adsorption in the low pressure domain as well as the Henry\~Os constants are reported for each investigated system. The effect of the extra-framework cations on adsorbate/adsorbent interactions are discussed on the basis of the values of differential enthalpies of adsorption at zero coverage. This quantity increases in the sequences LiX $>$ NaX $>$ KX and CaX $>$ SrX $>$ BaX for both argon and nitrogen. These experimental trends can be interpreted from predominant polarisation effects induced by the cations for argon adsorption whereas a combination of both electrostatic and polarisation contributions is required for nitrogen adsorption.},
